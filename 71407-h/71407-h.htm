<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Despite</span> the fact that we live in a small
and thickly populated country, we are
singularly rich in song birds, thanks to
our numerous old furze-clad commons,
game preserves, and a healthy sentiment
in the great majority of rich and poor
alike towards the wee, feathered carol-singers
that make grove and hillside
ring with their sweet, happy music.</p>

<p>This little book deals in a concise and
popular manner with the appearance,
haunts, habits, nests, eggs, songs, and
call notes of the winged melodists that
breed in various parts of the British
Islands. I have endeavoured to describe
them in such a way that the reader may
be able to identify them for himself or
herself in wood and field, and where two
species bear a similarity of appearance
or song, to emphasise the points wherein
they differ.</p>

<p>The study of our native song birds
will be found to contain many delightful
curiosities, and to present not a few
entertaining problems. For instance, all
our first-class melodists, such as the
Nightingale, Song Thrush, Blackcap
Warbler, Woodlark, and Garden Warbler,
are dressed in the most sober of sober
colours. Male migrants generally arrive
upon our shores before the females, and
at once commence to sing and practise
all kinds of curious antics in order to
attract the attention of their prospective
brides when they arrive. Individual
birds of the same species vary greatly in
the quality of their songs, and nearly all
the members of a species sometimes sing
better in one part of the country than
another. Birds are first-class plagiarists,
and not only copy each other’s notes,
but upon occasion actually improve the
quality of the music they borrow. Some
of them, such as the Chaffinch, practise
their notes thousands of times per day,
and a Song Thrush sings as many as
sixteen hours out of the twenty-four.</p>

<p>The following questions in regard to
the behaviour of some of our feathered
melodists are amongst those put to me
by both young and old after my lectures,
and contain a good deal of food for reflection:
Why do some birds sing by
night as well as by day after they have
mated? Why do some birds cease to sing
as soon as their young ones are hatched,
and others continue practically all the
year round? Why does a caged Skylark
sing blithely in a dingy alley, where he
has no mate to attract, no rival to
challenge, nor any apparent condition
of life to induce a feeling of happiness?
Why does a Skylark practise its notes
on the ground more during the closing
than the opening part of the season?
How do birds know of a coming change
in the weather and sing joyously to foretell
it long before man, with all his
acquired experience, is aware of the
fact? Why do some winged melodists,
such as the Blackbird for instance, sing
the best during a shower of rain? Is it
in anticipation of an increased supply of
food? Would a chick that had never
heard the song of its own species be able
to sing it when it grew up?</p>

<p>No answer to many of these interesting
questions that are constantly cropping
up will be found in any ornithological
work with which I am acquainted, and
they show two things clearly to my
mind, viz.: How little we really know
about even our common song birds, and
what a great desire there is on the part
of the public to find out.</p>

<p>Nature is never prodigal in the giving
up of her secrets, but the diligent student
is sure to discover some interesting
fact or solve some entertaining problem;
and I would urge all young people who
care for the delights of the country to
take up the study of Nature’s charming
musicians. They will find it deeply
interesting to learn to identify birds by
their songs and call notes, and even to
imitate the latter with sufficient skill to
attract members of the species to which
they belong.</p>

<p>Finally, I trust I may be permitted
to hope that this little book will stimulate
an interest in our song birds, which
have always been a never-ending source
of solace and delight to me.</p>

notes of the
Cuckoo are loved by
young and old alike,
because they tell a
tale of hope and
gladness, of warm
sunshine and sweet
spring flowers. It
has been regarded as
“the darling of the
year” all down the ages since the oldest
known English lyric, in which it figures,
was penned:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
    <div class="i1a">“Sumer is icumen in,</div>
    <div class="i1">Loude sing Cuckoo.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Cuckoo is a strange, mysterious
bird whose history is not yet fully known
in spite of all the careful attention it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
has received at the
hands of naturalists
for generations.</p>

<p>It arrives in this
country during April,
and departs again in July,
leaving its uncared-for
young ones to follow, in
August and September,
to the winter quarters
of the species in Africa’s sunny clime.</p>

PIPIT STRETCHING HERSELF
AFTER HAVING
FED YOUNG CUCKOO.</p>
</div><!--end figure-->

<p>The bird makes no attempt whatever
at nest-building, but deposits its eggs
singly, as a rule in those of small birds,
and allows the little dupes to hatch
out and rear its young. From its similarity
in appearance to a small hawk the
ancients believed that in the winter it
changed into one. They were also firmly
convinced that young Cuckoos not only
swallowed all the other chicks in the
nests in which they were hatched out
themselves, but, as a mark of ingratitude,
finally devoured their foster-parents.
Although this was, of course,
quite wrong, the real facts of the bird’s
life and career are quite as romantic,
as we shall see presently.</p>

<p>Up to quite recently, people supposed
that the female Cuckoo, when about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
to lay, watched the nest of some small
bird until the owner left it in search of
food, when she stealthily sat down and
dropped one of her own eggs into the
structure. Unfortunately for this theory,
it would not hold good in the case of
domed nests built by such species as the
Common Wren and Willow Warbler,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
both of which are occasionally victimised.
This puzzle has been satisfactorily
solved by the discovery of
the real facts. The Cuckoo lays her
eggs upon the ground, and, picking
them up in her bill, deposits them in
the homes of birds whose own productions
they will to some extent match
in colours.</p>

<p class="captionleft">CUCKOO’S EGG IN MEADOW
PIPIT’S NEST.</p>
</div><!--end figure-->

<p>Cuckoo’s eggs vary very widely in
point of coloration. They are usually
reddish grey, mottled and spotted closely
with darker markings of the same
colour, or pale greyish-green marked
with spots of a darker hue. I have met
with them matching in colours those of
the Meadow Pipit, Pied Wagtail, and
Reed Warbler so closely that they were
scarcely discernible except for their larger
size, and a blue specimen has been found
in the nest of a Hedge Sparrow.</p>

<p>Some naturalists are of opinion that
a Cuckoo is able to lay an egg of any
colour at will, whilst others favour the
opinion that if an egg closely resembles
in point of coloration those of the bird,
say a Tree Pipit, in whose nest it has
been placed, that young Cuckoo’s grandfather
and grandmother were also reared
by Tree Pipits.</p>

<p>Another important
fact which aids deception
when trying to impose
upon small birds
is that a Cuckoo’s egg
is only one-quarter the
size of what might
reasonably be expected
from the dimensions of
its layer. It is much
heavier, however, than
any other egg of its
size, and has a thicker
shell.</p>

<p>Competent naturalists
have asserted that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
the Cuckoo lays as many as five eggs
during a season, and although only
one specimen as a rule is found in the
nest of an intended foster-parent, as
many as three may be met with, but
whether deposited by the same individual
or not, it is, of course, impossible
to say. Hedge Sparrows and Robins
are the greatest victims, but even the
Jay, Wood Pigeon, and Carrion Crow
have been successfully imposed upon.</p>

<p>With a view to finding out whether
the deceptive path of the bird that
“tells its name to all the hills around”
is a smooth one or not, some years ago
I had four wooden eggs made and
painted to resemble those of the Song
Thrush. I tried my counterfeits upon
several different species, such as Starlings,
Song Thrushes, and Grasshopper
Warblers, and deceived them straight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
away without the slightest trouble, but
when I attempted to impose upon a
Ringed Plover, whose eggs I found in
a little declivity on a shingly beach,
she detected the fraud at once, and
tapping my dummy eggs with her bill,
turned round and walked away in
disgust.</p>

<p>In order to prove how easily some
birds are duped, I may mention that
two lady friends of mine have, for the
last three or four seasons, taken a clutch
of Starling’s eggs out of a hole in a
stable wall, and replaced them by one
common fowl’s egg, and that on each
occasion the foster-mother has successfully
hatched out a chick.</p>

</div><!--end figure-->

<p>The young Cuckoo arrives into the
world without a scrap of down or the
sign of a feather on its dusky, ugly
little body. Very soon after it is hatched
it begins to show signs of great restlessness
and energy, endeavouring to
throw out whatever else there may be
in the nest in the shape of eggs or
young. Nature has equipped the little
monster well for its murderous task,
by providing a hollow between its
broad shoulders for the reception of
its victims. It makes great efforts to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
get beneath whatever else is in the nest
in which it has been hatched, and when
it gets an egg or chick upon its back,
with raised wings, head depressed, and
a foot firmly
planted on either
side of the nest,

<p>This wonderful performance
was first observed
by the great
Dr. Jenner of vaccination
fame, and
afterwards confirmed
by the observations and
wonderfully accurate pictures made by
my friend Mrs. Blackburn. Curiously
enough, her daughter, Miss Blackburn,
found the Meadow Pipit’s nest from
which her mother saw the rightful owners
ejected by the young Cuckoo and also
the nest belonging to the same species
figured on page 3 of this work.</p>

<p>Sometimes two young Cuckoos are
hatched out in the same nest, and then a
great struggle takes place between them
for possession.</p>

<p>Very odd things occasionally occur in
regard to Cuckoo’s eggs. I have found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
one, perfectly fresh, covered over with
moss and down inside a Hedge Sparrow’s
nest wherein the bird had laid
none of her own. I have known one
lie untouched outside a Meadow Pipit’s
nest, but whether left there by the
layer or cast forth by the owner of the
structure it is impossible to say.</p>

<p>A short time ago a friend of mine found
a Sedge
Warbler’s
nest near
Gloucester
with four
eggs in it.
The following day
when we returned
to the place the
nest contained
only three and a
Cuckoo’s egg. As
I wanted a photograph
of a member
of the species for the
present work, I parted the
thick sedge grass and, erecting
my camera within a
few feet, got everything
ready and went into hiding
beneath my apparatus. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
less than two minutes she returned and,
gazing into her home, suddenly grew
greatly agitated and began to hammer
the Cuckoo’s egg unmercifully with her
bill. Fearing that she might break it
before I secured a photograph, I jumped
up and drove her away, at the same
time calling my companion over to
take care of the object of her resentment.
Directly it was gone she
assumed all her native gentleness of
manner and sat down upon her own
eggs quite happy.</p>

<p>Although young Cuckoos show so
much sagacity in getting rid of any
other occupants of the nest in which
they have been hatched, they sometimes
exhibit great stupidity in other directions.
For instance, the young bird
shown with his Tree Pipit foster-mother
in the illustrations figuring in this chapter
did not understand the alarm cry
of the little brown bird at all. It did
not matter however loudly she cried
“danger” outside the nest up to a certain
stage in his career, if he heard anything
moving he shot up his head and opened
his mouth very widely in request of
food. Then, again, if a newly fledged
Cuckoo happens to be resting on level<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
ground and his
foster-mother, say
a Robin, Hedge
Sparrow or Pied
Wagtail, comes
along with a
supply of food, he
has not the sense
to accommodate
himself to the stature
of his wee parent,
for, instead of lowering
his great dappled
head, he rears it as
high in the air as he
can, and the feeder
has to stand on his
shoulders, as shown in
the accompanying photograph,
and literally
drop the food down
his throat.</p>

<p>The food of adult
Cuckoos is insectivorous,
and consists largely
of hairy caterpillars such as those of
the Drinker Moth.</p>

<p>The Cuckoo sings upon the wing, and
sometimes keeps up its vocal efforts
all night long. It has been asserted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
that only the male cries “Cuckoo,”
but this is not the fact, as females have
been shot in the act of singing.</p>

<p>On the Yenisei its cry is “Hoo-hoo.”</p>

<p>Gilbert White, in his delightful
“Natural History of Selborne,” says
that some Cuckoos sing in D, some in D
sharp, and some in C, and that the two
former whilst performing together make
a very disagreeable duet.</p>

<p>The notes of the bird are easily
imitated by the human voice, and in
the springtime I often amuse my friends
by calling individuals into their gardens.</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">I love</span> Robin Redbreast
above all other birds.
He is a bold, handsome
fellow, and one of the
sweetest songsters
of the grove. When
the Nightingale and
the Blackcap have
gone to their winter
quarters in the faraway
sunny South, and
both the Thrush and the
Skylark are silent, courageous Redbreast
mounts to the topmost branch of some
sodden, leafless tree and defiantly pours
out his sweet, silvery notes.</p>

<p>Poets of all ages have noticed this
peculiar characteristic, and one of them
has expressed it very happily in the
following lines:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
    <div class="i4">“Each woodland pipe is mute</div>
    <div class="i1">Save when the Redbreast mourns the falling leafs;</div>
    <div class="i1">Now plaintively, in interrupted trills,</div>
    <div class="i1">He sings the dirge of the departing year.”</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>
<p>There can be no doubt that the conditions
under which the bird sings help
to rivet our attention upon its performance,
just in the same way that the
Nightingale gains some of its popularity
by singing at night time when other
woodland vocalists are silent, and the
Skylark by soaring away up in the
blue vault of heaven whilst pouring out
its far-sounding music.</p>

Cock Robin has received a great deal
of poetic attention, and it is amusing
to note how differently the bards have
expressed themselves in regard to this
familiar bird “that swells its little
breast so full of song.” Some of them
say it warbles, others it whistles, tootles,
carols, chirps, sings, sobs, mourns, and
so on.</p>

<p>Any boy or girl who has wandered
through the woods in winter will at once
recognise the truth and beauty of the following
lines from Cowper’s “Winter’s
Walk at Noon”:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
    <div class="i1a">“No noise is here, or none that hinders thought;</div>
    <div class="i1">The Redbreast warbles still, but is content</div>
    <div class="i1">With slender notes and more than half suppressed;</div>
    <div class="i1">Pleased with his solitude, and flitting light</div>
    <div class="i1">From spray to spray where’er he rests, he shakes</div>
    <div class="i1">From many a twig the pendent drops of ice,</div>
    <div class="i1">That tinkle in the wither’d leaves below.</div>
    <div class="i1">Stillness accompanied with sounds so soft</div>
    <div class="i1">Charms more than silence.”</div>
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>Numbers of beautiful legends have
been woven round the bird. For instance,
its ruddy breast is supposed to
be worn in memory of the day when Jesus
was led forth from Jerusalem to be
crucified, and the wee bird perched upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
the Cross and “tried with all its little
might to diminish the anguish of the
crown of thorns.”</p>

It was an old and popular belief that
Robins covered over the bodies of dead
men with leaves, hence John Webster’s
ballad:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
    <div class="i1a">“Call for the Robin Redbreast and the Wren,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></div>

</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p class="unindent">and the well-known one, “Babes in the
Wood.”</p>

<p>Although Cock Robin is at all times a
bold bird in defence of his rights, and at
some seasons liable to be considered quarrelsome
and spiteful, he undoubtedly
has his good points. For instance, one
has been known lovingly and diligently
to feed his mate after she had sustained
some injury to her bill which rendered
her unable to peck for herself, and
I have myself watched and even photographed
a Redbreast in the charitable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>act of feeding a family of young Thrushes
in the nest whilst their mother was away
searching for very difficult-to-find food
during a cold, dry spring morning.</p>

<p>Male Robins differ from the females
only in the facts that they are slightly
larger and have rather brighter orange-red
breasts. These differences, however,
are so very trifling that it is by no means
easy for even the practised eye to notice
them.</p>

<p><div class="figcenter">

 alt="YOUNG ROBIN">
 <p class="caption">YOUNG ROBIN IN ITS FIRST COAT
OF FEATHERS.</p>
</div><!--end figure-->

<p class="p2">Robins commence to breed in March,
and make their nests of bits of dead
grass, leaves, and moss, with an inner
lining of hair. At the beginning of
the season building operations are conducted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
in quite a leisurely way, occupying
as much as a fortnight, but later
on no time is lost, and nests are made
in a much shorter period.</p>

<p>Last spring I watched a female, quite
unaided by her mate, who was singing
very loudly morning, noon, and night
in my garden, build a nest in three days.
One morning she carried dead leaves and
moss to her home five times in five
minutes!</p>

<p>Although generally selecting holes in
banks and walls where a brick or a stone
has fallen out, this species is famed for
its apparent love of odd situations in
which to breed. I have found Robins’
nests in old tin cans, tea-pots, coffee-pots,
kettles, jam-jars, biscuit boxes, cocoanut
husks, fragments of bottles, and
clock cases, and have seen them in bookcases
and other places inside the much-used
rooms of dwelling-houses.</p>

<p>Robins lay five or six eggs, as a rule,
although as many as seven, and even
eight, are occasionally found in one nest.
They are white or light grey, blotched
and freckled with dull light red. Sometimes
the markings join each other nearly
all over the shell, and at others they are
collected round the larger end.</p>

BRINGING<br>FOOD TO HER YOUNG.</p>
</div><!--end figure-->

<p class="p2">Young Robins, when they
grow their first coats of feathers,
do not have red breasts
like their parents, but are
dressed in varying shades of
brown that render them very
difficult to see when sitting
still, amongst the lights and
shades of a hedgerow. Directly
they have donned their
second coats of feathers, which
happens in July and August,
and become like their parents
in appearance, they commence
to try to sing. It is
said that when they have
been bred near Nightingales
they borrow notes from that
sweet-voiced bird, and
introduce them into
their own songs. I
can readily believe this,
because I have heard
a Redbreast imitate
the song of a Sedge
Warbler so well that
I was completely deceived
until I saw the
vocalist.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
describe a Robin’s song, because almost
everyone has an opportunity of hearing
it, and seeing the bird at the same
time. Its call and alarm notes, however,
are frequently uttered when the
creature is not visible. The former is
a rapidly repeated metallic sounding
<i>tit-tit-tit</i>, and the latter a plaintive, long-drawn
<i>chee</i>, generally uttered when some
intruder is near the nest.</p>

<p>The species feeds principally upon insects,
and is especially fond of spiders,
which are sought for in the cracks of old
walls, mossy banks, and on the bark of
trees. All boys and girls who have read
“Pilgrim’s Progress” will remember how
Mercy wondered and Christiana was disappointed
to learn that Robins fed upon
spiders instead of breadcrumbs, and the
lesson Interpreter drew from it.</p>

<p>Robins differ individually in character
almost as much as human beings. I
have been vigorously attacked by a
courageous mother bird of this species
because I dared to look at her young ones
in the nest. On the other hand, some individuals
are quite timid and shy, and
will quickly put a safe distance between
themselves and the most harmless intruder.</p>

<p>Occasionally one meets with a Redbreast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
living a bachelor or old maid
existence at some secluded farmhouse
high up amongst the hills or on some
lonely treeless island round our coast.</p>

<p>I have a male member of the species in
my garden that always superintends my
digging operations, and varies his search
for upturned grubs by standing on a clod
within a few inches of my spade and
singing me the sweetest of little songs.
May he long live to do so!</p>

<p class="p2 footnote"><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> During the middle ages it was a generally
accepted belief that Jenny Wren was Cock Robin’s
mate, and curiously enough, many people still think
that Wrens are female Robins. Of course such is
not at all the case, as the birds belong to widely
different species.</p>

with his sable coat,
orange bill, and peculiar
habit of
erecting his tail when
he alights? In the
North of England the
bird still enjoys its old
name of Ouzel, and in
Scotland it is called a
Merle.</p>

<p>The hen differs
somewhat in her appearance
from the cock
in being of a dark, rusty-brown colour
instead of “so black of hue,” as Shakespeare
has it of her mate.</p>

<p>This species is common in gardens,
orchards, shrubberies, hedgerows, and
woods all over the British Islands. I
have even met with it breeding in a little
garden close to the Atlantic in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
outermost island of the Hebridean group
and within sight of lone St. Kilda.</p>

<p class="p2">Its nest is placed in isolated thorn
bushes, evergreens of all kinds, hedges,
in trees sometimes at a considerable
elevation, in holes in dry stone walls, in
sheds, and even amongst grass upon the
level ground. Last spring I saw two in
the grass, one inside a thrashing machine,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
and another joined to the nest of a Song
Thrush on a wooden bar inside a cattle
shed, and all of them were within a few
yards of suitable hedgerows. The structure
is composed of small dead twigs,
roots, dry grass, and moss intermixed with
clay or mud, and lined with fine, dry grass.</p>

<p>The eggs, numbering from four to six,
are of a dull bluish-green, spotted and
blotched with reddish-brown and grey.
Occasionally specimens may be met with
having a few hair-like lines on the larger
end. The eggs vary considerably in regard
to size, shape, and coloration.</p>

<p>Blackbirds breed from March until
June, July, and even August, and have
been known to rear as many as four
broods in a single season. Young birds
of the first brood sometimes help their
parents to feed the chicks of a second
family.</p>

<p>The glory of an Ouzel’s song consists
not so much in its variety and compass
as in the rich, flute-like melodiousness
of its tones and the easy, leisurely manner
of their delivery. They are readily distinguished
from the hurried, vehement,
hope-inspiring notes of the Song Thrush
by their mellowness, stately delivery,
and touch of melancholy.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
Blackbirds sing principally during the
morning and evening, but as a rule do not
commence quite as early or go on so late
as Throstles. A warm spring shower
will, however, always draw the best and
sweetest music from the Merle at whatever
hour of the day it may fall. This
species loves to sing from a dead, bare
bough, standing well above the surrounding
foliage, but occasionally holds
forth on the wing, and I have heard
one sing habitually from a housetop in
the Outer Hebrides.</p>

<p>Although the male Blackbird helps
the female to feed their nestlings, this
does not put a stop to his vocal efforts.
He frequently carols a few notes near the
nest directly after he has delivered his
catch of worms and grubs, and this fact
may, to some extent, account for the
chicks commencing to sing three months
after they have been hatched.</p>

<p>Some members of this species will
sing off and on as late as the end of July,
and commence again as early even as
September.</p>

<p>The Blackbird, when heard at very
close quarters, may be discerned to
imitate the notes of other species, as I
have discovered when lying in hiding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
trying to obtain phonographic records
of its song. It is said to be able to reproduce
the crowing of a cock or the
cackle of a laying hen, and even snatches
of popular songs.</p>

<p>The bird’s call note is a <i>tisserr, tack,
tack</i>, and its well-known ringing alarm
cry, <i>spink, spink, spink</i>.</p>

staying in the Outer
Hebrides, where it is
far more numerous
than in any other
part of the British
Isles. In general appearance,
flight, and
habits it closely resembles
its relative, the Common Linnet,
but may be distinguished from that
species by the fact that it has a longer
tail and more slender form, a yellow
beak, and lacks the crimson colouring

feet of his mate sitting on her nest in the

<p class="p2">It is said to breed in the North of
England, but although I have met with
the bird in great flocks, both in Yorkshire
and Westmorland, during the autumn,
I never discovered its nest upon the
Fells. I have found it breeding on several
Highland mountains, but as already
stated, most numerously in the Outer
Hebrides. How abundant it actually is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
in the Western Isles may be gathered
from the fact that I have found no fewer
than seven nests in the course of a zig-zag
walk of a mile or so from the house
of one friend to that of another. As an
indication of the wide variety of sites
chosen by the Mountain Linnet—as the
bird is sometimes called—for its little
home, I will mention the places in which
I discovered the above-named nests. Two
were in holes in a dry stone wall, the one
containing eggs, figured in our illustration,
at the top of a stone wall and sheltered
by a piece of overhanging turf, which had
been placed there to increase the height
of the fence; one in a tuft of heather
growing close to a half-buried rock; one
in a furze bush where a Common Linnet’s
nest might have been expected; another
in a stunted gooseberry bush; and the
last in an ivy geranium growing inside a
small greenhouse, to which the birds
gained entrance through a broken pane
in the roof. On more than one occasion
I have found a nest, containing eggs or
young ones, under an overhanging tuft
of grass growing from a crevice of rock
on the small piece of North Uist Coast
shown in the tailpiece to this article.</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> Wood Wren, or
Wood Warbler as it is
sometimes called,
measures just over
five inches in length.
On its upper parts
it is olive-green tinged
with yellow, except in
the case of its wings and
tail, which are dusky.
The chin, cheeks, throat,
and breast are yellow, and under parts
white. A line of bright yellow runs
from the base of the bill over the eye.
The bird may be distinguished from its
relative, the Willow Wren, by its larger
size, broader yellow band over the eye,
greener upper parts, and whiter abdomen,
also by its longer wings. Its nest is also
a safe guide to correct identification, as
will be shown presently.</p>

<p>The female is similar to the male in
her appearance.</p>

<p class="p2">This species loves woods containing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
tall beech and other trees, and although
of somewhat local occurrence, may be
met with in nearly all suitable parts of
England and Wales. It is rarer in Scotland
and
Ireland.
It is difficult
to
study,
except at
the nest,
on account of its habit of hunting
for insects amongst the leaves near the
tops of trees. However, its plaintive
call note and very characteristic song
are constantly being uttered, and can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
never be mistaken for those of any
other bird.</p>

</div><!--end figure-->

<p class="p2">Its nest is built on the ground amongst
thick herbage, is oval in shape, and
domed. The outside consists of dry
grass, dead leaves, and moss, with an
inner lining of fine dead grass and horsehair.
Although in general appearance
the structure is almost exactly like those
of the Willow Wren and Chiffchaff, it
may always be distinguished with certainty
from them by the absence of
feathers.</p>

<p>The eggs, numbering five or six, are
white, thickly spotted all over with
dark purplish-brown and violet-grey.</p>

<p>The song, although short, is clear,
loud, sweet, oft repeated, and sounds
something like <i>sit-sit-sit-sit-sit-see-eeeeeze</i>.
Each of the opening notes of the song is
uttered more rapidly than that which
preceded it, until they develop into a
kind of trill, rising in pitch all the time,
and finally end in a long, shaky, thin
one. The melody is accompanied by
rapid vibrations of the wings and tail,
as if the loud voice shook the body of
the wee singer.</p>

<p>The call note is a plaintive <i>twee</i>
or <i>tway tway</i>, frequently used as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
kind of alternative to the song described
above.</p>

<p>Although such a small bird, the Wood
Wren is very courageous at the nest.
The individual figured in our illustration
repeatedly attacked my hand with
bill and wings when I attempted to disturb
her in her maternal duties. She was
very angry with me when the photograph
was secured, and incidentally it shows the
great length of wing in this species.</p>

<p>This Warbler is a late arrival upon our
shores, coming about the end of April
and departing again in September. It
lives entirely upon insects.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">THE RING OUZEL.</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="unindent">Mountain</span> solitudes, with lonely crag-strewn
glens and rough, deep gulches,
“far removed from the busy haunts of
men,” form the home of this brave, independent
bird. If a few stunted rowan
or whitethorn trees peep shyly from
sheltered corners and crevices here and
there the better will the situation be
liked.</p>

<p>The Ring Ouzel arrives in this country
in April and quits our shores again during
September and October. It is about
the same size as the Common Blackbird,
and behaves more or less like a member
of that well-known species. In colour
it is dull black with an edging of dark
grey to the feathers. Across the chest
stretches a broad crescent-like band of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
pure white. The female is rather lighter
coloured, and the white gorget on her
breast is neither so broad nor so pure.</p>

<p>This species breeds in the West of
England, in the six northern counties,
and in suitable parts of Wales, Scotland,
and Ireland.</p>

<p>Its song consists of a few clear, powerful
notes that would sound out of place
if heard anywhere but amongst the bird’s
wild, lonely surroundings. During a
calm spring evening the plaintive, lonesome
notes of the Mountain Blackbird,
as this species is sometimes called, can
be heard at a great distance because
the singer has a habit of delivering its
music from a high boulder or cairn.</p>

<p>The alarm cry is a loud <i>tac-tac-tac</i>,
which is uttered with great volubility
and vehemence when the nest containing
young ones is approached.</p>

</div><!--end figure-->
 
<p class="p2">I have found the nest of the Ring
Ouzel, which is a very similar structure
to that of the Blackbird, amongst long
heather growing upon a steep bank by
a burn-side, amongst rocks in the face
of small broken cliffs, under sheltering
stones projecting from the ground, on
steep hillsides, and in holes in old stone
walls. I once discovered one amongst<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
rushes on flat ground, but this is an
exceptional kind of situation.</p>

<p><div class="figcenter">

 <p class="caption">FEMALE RING OUZEL COVERING
YOUNG<br>IN NEST DURING A
SHOWER OF RAIN.</p>
</div><!--end figure-->

<p class="p2">Although a comparatively shy, wary
bird under ordinary circumstances, the
Ring Ouzel is possessed of great courage,
which it rarely fails to display in the
defence of its young. I have on more
than one occasion watched members of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
the species driving stray Kestrels away
from the neighbourhood of their nests.
They will fly close round the head of a
human intruder, uttering discordant
cries if their chicks are molested.</p>

<p>The eggs are very similar to those of
the Common Blackbird, bluish-green in
ground colour, marked with reddish-brown
spots. The markings are, as a
rule, however, larger than those on the
eggs of the above-mentioned species.</p>

<p>Young Ring Ouzels have no white
collar or gorget on the breast. Their
feathers are brownish-black, edged with
dirty white, and when they sit still on a
grey limestone or under a ledge they are,
in consequence, difficult to see.</p>

<div class="figleft">
 <img src="images/i065.jpg"
 alt="flowers">
</div><!--end figure-->

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">We</span> have three Pipits
breeding in the British Islands—viz.
the Meadow,
Rock, and Tree, which are
all very well named according
to their respective habits.
Owing, however, to, their
similarity of general appearance,
the two latter species
are frequently mistaken for
the first, and described as
Titlarks.</p>

<p>The plumage of the Tree
Pipit is sandy brown in colour, streaked
with dark brown above, light buff
with streaky dark brown spots on
breast, and dull white on the under
parts. It is rather larger than the
Meadow Pipit, its colours are brighter,
and it has a curved hind claw which is
shorter than the toe from which it
springs, whereas in the case of its relative
the Meadow Pipit the hind claw is
long and nearly straight. This shows a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
wonderful provision of Nature. The first-named
bird is wholly migratory, and
perches on trees, hence the short curved
claw must render it very useful for grasping
branches; the second is only partially
migratory, great numbers staying in this
country throughout the year, and its long
hind claw must prove very advantageous
as a snowshoe during the winter.</p>

</div><!--end figure-->
 
<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
As its name implies, the species under
notice frequents parts of the country
where trees grow, preferably in clumps
with grassy glades between.</p>

<p>The male Tree Pipit is a very sweet
singer, and makes his music more attractive
by the manner in which he delivers
it. He alights generally on the topmost
branch of some favourite tree, from
which elevation he mounts the air to
varying heights of from twenty to sixty
or seventy feet by a series of rapid wing
beats, commences to utter his song with
a <i>chee, chee, chee, chee</i>, when he has
reached a sufficient altitude for his purpose,
and delivers it whilst he is gliding
down slowly in a kind of half-circle
through the air with outstretched wings,
expanded tail, and dangling legs.</p>

<p>When in full song this bird is a most
energetic vocalist. I timed one upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
my watch last spring, and found that on
an average he sang five times per minute,
and three times out of the five the music
was delivered upon his favourite perch.
The perching song only lasted two or
three seconds, as a rule, whereas the flying
one took from five to seven seconds—according
to the height from which
the bird started—to get through.</p>

<p class="p2">The song
of this species
has been
likened to
that of the
Canary, and
in some respects
it
does undoubtedly
resemble it.
It commences
with the lark-like notes already
mentioned, and ends with a ringing
<i>tsee, tsee, tsee</i>, or <i>whee, whee, whee</i>.</p>

<p>Tree Pipits vary greatly in the quality
of their music. One of the very finest
singers I ever heard was on a hillside
near to Builth Wells, in Wales. The call
note is a <i>trit, trit</i>, or <i>t’sip, t’sip</i>.</p>

<p>It has been said that the male birds of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
this species are seldom found living
within hearing distance of each other
during the breeding season.</p>

<p>The nest is built on the ground, and is
generally sheltered by a tuft of herbage
growing on a grassy bank. It is composed
of rootlets and moss with an inner lining
of fine grass and hair. The eggs number
from four to six, of very variable coloration.
Some are dull white, so closely
mottled and spotted with dark brown
as to almost hide the ground colour,
whilst others have the greyish-white
ground colour tinged with purple, and
are spotted and clouded with purple-brown
and purple-red.</p>

<p>The Tree Pipit arrives upon our shores
in April and leaves again in September
and October.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">THE WOODLARK.</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> Woodlark is not nearly so common
or widely distributed as the Skylark,
and is frequently thought to be heard and
seen when the bird under observation
is really only a Tree Pipit.</p>

<p>It is smaller than the Skylark, and
has a much shorter tail and more conspicuous
crest. Although of somewhat
similar coloration, it has a distinct light
yellowish streak running over each eye
and meeting at the back of the head;
the breast spots are more distinct; and
its flight always appears to me to be
more undulatory.</p>

<p>The Woodlark is a shy creature, but
had it not been for the very wet and benumbingly
cold weather prevailing at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
time I figured the young one shown in
our illustration on page 56—which could
fly quite well—I feel sure that I could
have photographed one or both of the
parent birds feeding it.</p>

<p>This species is considered by many
people to come next to the Nightingale
as one of Nature’s Carol Singers. Its
voice is certainly sweeter in tone, though
it lacks both the power and variety of
that of the Common Skylark. Yarrell
says that “its soothing notes never sound
more sweetly than while the performer
is mounting in the air by wide circles,
or, having attained the summit of its
lofty flight, is hanging almost stationary
overhead.”</p>

<p>That is exactly how the bird’s delightfully
flute-like notes affect me, although
many people find an element of sadness
in them. Burns, for instance, considered
the Woodlark’s song a mixture of love
and sorrow, and exclaimed:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
    <div class="i1">“For pity’s sake, sweet bird, nae mair</div>
    <div class="i2">Or my poor heart is broken.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It sings whilst perched upon a tree,
and sometimes its clear, tender notes
may be heard ringing out during a fine
summer’s night.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
The call notes of the species are a very
musical double one, sounding something
like <i>lu-lu</i> and <i>tweedle, weedle, weedle</i>,
uttered on the wing.</p>

<p>The Woodlark, like the Tree Pipit, although
roosting upon the ground, procuring
its food and rearing its young
there, must have some kind of timber,
whether it be
great belts of fir,
with pastures and dry, heather-clad
commons between, or bare hillsides with
scattered clumps of oak and bushes here
and there to make its home amongst.</p>

<p class="p2">It is said to breed most numerously in
the southern counties of England, occasionally
in the north, and rarely in Scotland
and Ireland.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
Its nest is very similar to that of the
Common Skylark, but as a rule shows
a little better workmanship, perhaps, in
its construction. It is situated under a
tuft of grass, in heather, or at the foot
of a bush. Sometimes it is simply placed
in a little hollow on ground which does
not grow sufficient grass to form any
kind of shelter or hiding.</p>

<p>The eggs, numbering four or five, are
reddish-white, light brownish-yellow, or
greenish-white in ground colour, thickly
spotted and speckled with dull reddish-brown
and underlying markings of grey.</p>

<p>This species commences to breed in
March and rears two broods during the
season. It resides with us all the year,
but is subject to local movement.</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Everybody</span> knows and
loves the wee brown
Wren with its active,
pert ways and
cheerful rattling
song, which
is heard nearly
the whole of the
year round.</p>

<p>“Jenny” or
“Kitty” Wren,
as the bird is
often called, is to be met with
almost everywhere by sea-shore and
riverside, in the cultivated garden and
on the barren waste, along the plain and
on the mountain side, in thick woods
and treeless deserts where there is little
else than rocks for it to alight upon.
Whether the sun be shining, flowers
blooming, and food plentiful, or the
ground be wreathed in a thick blanket
of snow and the world a picture of desolation
and a place of hunger, the little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
bird is ever cheerful, active, and gay.
As the poets have it:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
    <div class="i1a">“When icicles hang dripping from the roof</div>
    <div class="i1">Pipes his perennial lay.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Its song is surprisingly loud and clear
for such a tiny musician, especially when
heard only a few inches away, as I have
heard it on several occasions whilst
crouching inside some of my hiding contrivances
waiting to secure a photograph
of some shy bird or beast. It is delivered
both upon the wing and when the
musician is at rest upon a branch or stone.</p>

<p>A Wren’s call notes sound something
like <i>tit, tit-it, tit-it-it, tit-it-it-it</i>, uttered
so quickly as to resemble the winding-up
of a clock.</p>

<p>Even in the depths of the very severest
winter weather, “Jenny” Wren refuses
to be “pauperised” like the Robin, the
Blackbird, and the Song Thrush, and disdaining
the help of man, hunts all day
long for its own support in a spirit of
hopeful independence. It does not matter
whether it is an old moss-grown stone
wall, a stack of loose firewood, or a
shrubbery, in and out goes the little nut-brown
bird from cold grey morn till
glooming eve, examining every crack<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
and cranny for
some lurking
morsel of insect
life.</p>

<p class="p2">It is strange
how such an innocent
and altogether
praiseworthy
little
bird should have
come to occupy
such an unenviable
position
in bird folklore.
The common
names of
this species in
most European
languages assign
kingly dignity
to it, and
it obtained
kingship of all
the birds by a
mean kind of
trick. A parliament
of birds
agreed that the
one that could
fly highest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
should be king. The Eagle easily
mounted to the greatest height, but
when he had reached it a little brown
Wren that had cunningly hidden itself
on his back fluttered a little higher,
and by this piece of deceit gained the
much-coveted honour. Whether for this
or some other equally supposed evil
deed, the poor bird used to be hunted
in our country every Christmas Day by
boys and men armed with sticks, and its
body publicly exhibited the following
day whilst money was begged to bury it.</p>

<p>Although the Common Wren is double
brooded and rears from four to eight
chicks twice each season, the stock never
seems to increase much from one year
to another. Nobody knows clearly what
becomes of all the birds. Of course,
natural death must claim a certain
number of victims, and I have no doubt
that both Owls and rats secure
many individuals whilst they are
asleep in holes in the thatches of
ricks. I have also found several frozen
to death during very severe weather in
the winter. In order to avoid this last
calamity the birds resort to a very ingenious
method of roosting. Although
they never go in flocks by day, eight or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
nine members of the species will congregate
together in one hole at night,
and by a combination of their natural
warmth sleep in snug safety.</p>

<p class="p2">A Wren’s nest is very large for the
size of the builder, is oval in shape, has
a domed top, and a small entrance-hole
in front. The bird is famous for the
number of nests it builds and never
occupies with either eggs or young.
These structures, which are not finished
inside by a lining of down or feathers,
are supposed to be built by the males,
and are called “cocks’” nests. Nobody
knows with any degree of certainty why
they are built. It has been suggested
to roost in during cold winter nights,
but careful investigations have convinced
me that there is nothing in this theory.</p>

<p>Boys and girls have an idea that if
they thrust an inquiring finger ever so
deftly into a Wren’s nest the bird is sure
to discover the fact and desert. Without
wishing for one moment to do poor
“Jenny” an ill turn by destroying
this wholesome fear and encouraging
investigation, the truth must be told.
There is really nothing in the theory.
If the structure be deserted, in all probability
it is a “cock’s” nest, and was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
never intended to be anything else by
its builder.</p>

<p>Wrens build in all kinds of situations—amongst
ivy growing upon walls and
round the trunks of trees, in the thatches
and sides of ricks, in holes in walls, in
banks amongst rocks, in hedges, amongst
the rafters of barns, and even in coils of
old rope and disused garments hanging
up in sheds.</p>

<p>When the nest is built in a mossy bank
the outside is generally made of moss;
when in the front of a hayrick it is made
of straws; and when amongst a few
slender twigs sprouting from the place
where some large bough has been sawn
from the trunk of a tree, of dead leaves.
These studied attempts, for such they
would seem, at concealment do not, however,
always hold good, for I have occasionally
found one made of moss in the
side of a hayrick.</p>

<p>“Jenny” Wren is a very industrious
builder. One day I was resting inside
an old tumble-down summer-house built
into a steep hillside in a Surrey park,
when, to my consternation, I saw a big
black feather coming straight as a partridge
towards me. There was not a
breath of wind blowing at the time, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
the whole thing struck me as being most
uncanny. Presently it stopped in a little
bush, and I saw a wee brown wren behind
it. The mystery was at once explained.
I sat perfectly still, and in a few
moments she brought the erstwhile awesome
feather into the summer-house,
and after considerable difficulty managed
to get the awkward piece of furniture
through her tiny front door. She brought
along another and another with surprising
speed, and before many days passed she
had laid six white eggs which were
spotted with brownish-red.</p>

return season after season with the utmost
regularity to some favourite clump
of gorse growing on a sandy common
or to an ancient reed-bed in the middle
of a water-logged marsh. It is very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
vigilant, shy, and timid, and the slightest
disturbance sends it instantly into
hiding amongst the thickest vegetation
it can find.</p>

<p>Upon his arrival in the spring the
male bird commences his queer, shrill
song, which sounds something like that
of a grasshopper, hence the popular name
given to the species.</p>

<p>Whilst living in a house-boat on the
Norfolk Broads, studying Nature, I have
had many excellent opportunities of
observing the habits of this interesting
bird, and have often heard it singing at
night when the stars were reflected on
the dark, still water around me and not
a breath of wind stirred the balmy air.
The best time of all, however, to hear a
Grasshopper Warbler in full song is at
sunrise. When the first gleam of rosy
light tints the dead brown reeds with
coppery red and dewdrops twinkle on
every blade of grass, the bird mounts to
the topmost twig of some stunted alder
bush or blade of sedge, and standing
quite still, with widely opened mouth
and quivering body, pours forth his
strange song in one incessant stream.
Whilst the music lasts the head is turned
from side to side, and it is this action<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
which appears to give it a ventriloquial
effect.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

 <p class="caption">GRASSHOPPER WARBLER ON NEST.</p>
</div><!--end figure-->
 
<p class="p2">If the bird be disturbed it instantly
ceases to sing, and dropping stealthily
into the undergrowth waits in silence
until the danger has passed; then it recommences.</p>

<p>When the singer is not seen, the exact
locality from which the sounds are proceeding
is very difficult to discover.
This arises from two facts—the shrillness
of the tones, as in the case of a mouse
squeaking when running about amongst
grass, and the movements of the head
already mentioned.</p>

<p>The sound, although somewhat similar
to that made by a grasshopper, is much
more sustained, and always appears to
me far more machine-like. In fact, it
is known in some parts of the country as
the “Reeler,” in recognition of the fact
that its notes resemble the sounds made
by a reel used during the last century by
hand-spinners of wool. Once the bird
has been heard, its song can never be
forgotten or mistaken for that of any
other British Bird. Its call note is a
sharp <i>tic, tic</i>.</p>

<p>The Grasshopper Warbler builds upon
the ground, or very near to it. Its nest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
is well hidden, and is composed of dead
grass and bits of moss, with an inner
lining of fine, fibrous grass.</p>

<p>The eggs, numbering from four to
seven, are of a pale rosy-white ground
colour, very thickly spotted and speckled,
especially at the larger end, with reddish-brown.</p>

<p>The bird approaches and leaves its
nest in the most mouse-like manner. I
have frequently taken it for one running
through the rough matted grass, even
when I knew the exact whereabouts of
its home which I was approaching.</p>

 alt="bunch of flowers">
</div><!--end figure-->

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> seems almost superfluous
to give a
word of description
concerning this well-known
and almost
universally distributed
song bird. The upper
parts of the Lavrock,
as it is sometimes
called, are of varying
shades of brown, the
darkest being in the centres
of the feathers, and the
lightest on their edges. The
under parts are pale straw colour, tinged
in parts with brown and spotted on the
breast with a dark hue of that colour.
It is about seven inches in length, and,
as most of my readers will have noticed,
has a greatly elongated hind claw. This
interesting provision of Nature acts the
useful part of a snow-shoe during severe
weather in the winter.</p>

<p>Although it leaves its higher breeding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
grounds in the autumn this species stays
with us all the year round, and has its
numbers greatly increased by migrants
arriving from the Continent.</p>

<p>The Skylark breeds in cultivated and
uncultivated districts alike throughout
the country. I have found its nest within
a few yards of the open Atlantic and at
an elevation of nearly two thousand feet
above sea-level.</p>

<p><div class="figcenter">

 alt="SKYLARK’S NEST AND EGGS.">
 <p class="captionright pneg">SKYLARK’S NEST AND EGGS.</p>
</div><!--end figure-->
 
<p class="p2">The nest is placed on the ground in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
slight hollow scratched out by the bird
under tufts of grass, ling, heath, in corn,
and amongst the sun-baked clods of
fallow fields. It is made of grass rootlets
and horsehair—frequently nothing
but the first-named, used sparingly with
the slenderest blades forming the inner
lining. I have found larks’ eggs from
April until the end of July. They number
four or five, of a dirty white ground
colour, occasionally tinged with olive-green,
thickly speckled and spotted with
olive-brown and underlying markings of
brownish-grey.</p>

<p>The sprightly song of the Skylark is
probably better known and remembered
by most people than even the appearance
of the familiar little brown bird itself.
Poets of all ages have praised it in their
verse, but nobody has ever excelled
Shakespeare’s golden line:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
    <div class="i1">“Hark! hark! the lark at heaven’s gate sings.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In a moderate breeze the Lavrock
rises almost perpendicularly, but during
a calm in circles, and with rapidly beating
wings pours out his loud, joyous song
until he sometimes reaches an altitude
of a thousand feet or more. Some people
say that the bird soars until it becomes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
invisible, but I have never in all my life
heard a Skylark when I could not see
it. However, it is only right to confess
that I am gifted with abnormally strong
eyesight. He continues to sing upon his
descent, but in a somewhat altered tone,
until approaching the ground, when his
carol suddenly ceases, and with closed
wings he drops like a stone to the earth.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div><!--end figure-->

<p class="p2">Early in the season Larks rise but a
small height in the air, and sing only for
a brief period; but in the full tide of their
joy they pour out their music for six,
seven, and even ten or fifteen minutes
without ceasing. During the latter part
of the season the males of this species
appear to grow idle and sing a good deal
upon the ground. I have also heard them
sing from the tops of gates, small bushes,
and even stunted trees.</p>

<p>I fondly imagined that everybody
loved the varied, sprightly, and unstinted
song of the Skylark until the other day,
when I happened to dip into an old book
on the subject of our song birds, and discovered
that the author described its
notes as “harsh and monotonous in the
extreme ... and when divested of
all associations they are a wretched concern ... wholly
devoid of melody.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
I thought that the writer was preparing
to justify himself for eating larks,
but this practice he appeared to decry
almost as much as the bird’s music.</p>

<p>Skylarks frequently borrow notes from
other birds. In the Outer Hebrides
great numbers of them introduce the
sweet call notes of the Ringed Plover
into their carols. Unless some enemy
in the shape of a Merlin appears in the
sky they always, or nearly always, end
their songs with a note sounding like
<i>hear-it, hear-it, hear-it</i>. The call sounds
like <i>tu-wit</i>, <i>twe-wit</i>, or <i>two wut</i>.</p>

very aptly named, for
the second syllable of
the word means tail.
It is also known in
many parts of the
country as Firetail,
and the bright rusty-red
colour of that appendage,
which is quite
unlike that of any other
British bird, and is constantly
being shaken and
quivered, renders it easy to
identify whenever and wherever it may
be seen.</p>

<p>This bird arrives upon our shores
about the second week in April, and
wings its way south again towards the
end of August, both movements being
subject to some modification in consequence
of the character of the weather
prevailing at the time it commences its
travels.</p>

<p class="p2">It is found breeding in suitable places
all over England and Wales, and less
numerously in Scotland. I have met
with it most commonly in certain parts
of the Principality and in Westmorland
and Northumberland. It appears
to be partial to isolated farmhouses
with a few old trees round them and
plenty of straggling, dilapidated outbuildings,
old ruins, and gardens surrounded
by moss-grown stone walls. I
have frequently found the bird, however,
breeding in solitary woods, and
secured the photograph showing the
nest and eggs figuring in this article in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
the silent depths of a great Highland
pine forest.</p>

<p>The male Redstart has a short but
soft and very sweet song, much resembling
that of the Pied Flycatcher. Whilst
staying out all night making observations,
both in South Wales and the North
of England, I have heard it very late in
the evening and very early in the morning.
It is oft repeated, and the singer
borrows notes from many other feathered
vocalists, such as the Swallow, Blackbird,
Whitethroat, and Nightingale.</p>

The nest is situated in a hole in a tree

partly buried in the ground, where a
Wheatear might be expected to make her
home, as in the case of the one figured in
our illustration on page 195. It is composed
of dry grass, dead leaves, and rootlets,
and lined with hair and feathers.</p>

<p>The eggs number from four to six
or even eight, although personally I
have never seen more than seven. They
are pale bluish-green, somewhat lighter
than those of the Hedge Sparrow, and
said to be occasionally marked with
light red spots. I have never met, however,
with this spotted variety.</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> Meadow Pipit, or
Titlark as the bird is
frequently called, is
much more abundant
than the Tree Pipit.
It is rather smaller in
size, duller in colour,
has more and smaller
spots on the breast, and
when hunting for food
has a habit of making
little periodical rushes after
insects in a more wagtail-like
manner than its relative.</p>

<p>This species is partial to open pastures,
and bent and heather-clad moorland
districts, and is very abundant on the
Fells in the North of England, where I
can safely say I have found hundreds of
nests during the course of my life. I
have met with it breeding quite commonly
as low down as the Norfolk
Broad district and as high up as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
most elevated mountain tops I have
ever visited in the Highlands.</p>

<p>Its song is somewhat shrill, and not
so musical as that of the Tree Pipit.
It is uttered on the wing, the bird rising
to a height of thirty or forty feet in order
to deliver it; also often from a stone
wall, stunted bush, or boulder.</p>

<p>The alarm note of this species when
flushed sounds like <i>peep, peep</i>, and that
of distress when disturbed at the nest
<i>trit, trit</i>. Call note: <i>zeeah, zeeah</i>.</p>

<p class="p2">The nest is generally built on a bank
and hidden by some overhanging tuft
of herbage, or amongst heather. I have,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
however, found two in holes amongst
rough stones where a Wheatear might

marked with hair-like
lines of dusky
black on the larger
end. They are smaller
in size than those laid
by the Tree Pipit.</p>

<p>This species is very
frequently victimised
by the Cuckoo, and I have often been
surprised at the lonely, treeless, and
semi-barren places the “Messenger of

is difficult to secure. On one
occasion I was shown a nest containing
chicks beneath a rock in the foreground
of our tailpiece, and although I built a
stone hiding-house for myself and the
camera, it was a long time before I exposed
a plate owing to the fact that the
female persisted in standing on a crag at
some distance and swallowing all the
food her mate brought instead of carrying
it to the young ones.</p>

parts of England.</p>

<p>In colour it is olive-green on its upper

whitish-yellow, and rest of under parts
greyish-white. The pale yellow line over

British Islands whenever trees or bushes

ground amongst
coarse
grass and
weeds entwining
themselves
round the
slender twigs
of small bushes
in woods, plantations,
orchards, hedge-banks,
and by
small alder-fringed
streams.
I have, however,
sometimes
seen it in
a hole in a dry
stone wall at
a considerable
height from
the ground
and on one
occasion found
a nest amongst
some ivy growing
against a
stable wall in
the Highlands
at an elevation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
of something like six feet from a
much-used garden path. The specimen

<p class="p2">The structure is dome-shaped with a
hole in front, and is composed of dead
grass, moss, and occasionally a few dead
leaves and fern fronds lined internally
with hair and a liberal number of feathers.
On one occasion I examined the lining of
a Willow Wren’s nest and found that it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
contained feathers from seven different
species of birds, and some of them had
been collected by the builder at a considerable
distance.</p>

<p>The eggs, numbering from four to
eight, are white, spotted with pale rusty-red,
whereas those of the Chiffchaff,
with which they are most likely to be
confused on account of the similarity
of the nests built by the birds, are
marked with dark purplish-brown.</p>

<p>The Willow Wren is one of the brightest
and sweetest carol singers visiting
our shores. Although its song is short
and contains but little variety, there is a
sprightliness and simplicity about it that
never fails to charm. I always associate
the bird’s thrice-welcome notes with the
babbling alder-fringed trout streams of
my youth, spring sunshine, and the sweet
freshness of expanding leaves.</p>

<p class="p2">John Burroughs, the great American
ornithologist, who once came over here
to study the song birds of our country,
said, “The Willow Wren has a long,
tender, delicious warble, not wanting in
strength and volume, but eminently
pure and sweet—the song of the Chaffinch
refined and idealised.... It mounts
up round and full, then runs down the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
scale and expires upon the air in a gentle
murmur.”</p>

<p>Willow Wrens proclaim their presence
directly they arrive in this country by
commencing to sing, and continue to
do so until the end of July. I have
heard one, together with a Robin and
a Song Thrush, carolling in my garden
to-day—the 16th of August. After
moulting, they commence their music
again in September, so they are not
long silent.</p>

<p>The song varies, like that of many
other melodists, in different parts of the
country, and is sometimes uttered on the
wing. The alarm note is a plaintive
<i>t-wheet</i>, with the first <i>t</i> suggested rather
than sounded.</p>

much more closely related to the
Robin than the Sparrow, this
bird has enjoyed its popular
name so long that it is likely to
be known by it to the end of
time. It also has two or three
others, such as Hedge Accentor,
used almost exclusively by ornithologists,
and Dunnock and
Shufflewing, which are more or
less local.</p>

<p>It is common nearly all over
the country—though I have never

orchards, hedgerows, and woods.</p>

<p>Some people do not care for the song

that I am an admirer of this wee brown
bird’s vocal accomplishments. Its notes,
although soft and lacking in variety,
are sweet and always have the true ring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>

Its call note is a plaintive

<p>The Hedge Sparrow, of course, stays
with us all the year round, and in the
winter hops quietly about in gardens,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 97]</span>
round fowl-houses and sinks, diligently
picking up the very tiniest particles of
food that other birds either do not see or
consider beneath their attention. When
disturbed it timidly retires beneath some
bush or hedge, and waits until all is
quiet, when it comes forth again with
a gentleness and modesty that win it a
great deal of sympathy during hard
weather.</p>

<p class="p2">It breeds early, and hides its nest, as
carefully as circumstances will permit, in
evergreens and thick hedgerows. Although
such a common species, it has one
habit which is not often mentioned in
books. When laying it frequently covers
over its eggs with part of the lining of the
nest before leaving them.</p>

<p>On one occasion I photographed a
Dunnock sitting on her nest in a bramble
bush, and wishing for a different view of
her returned the following morning in
order to secure it. When I approached
the place I observed the bird sitting at
home, but in endeavouring to get close
to her with my apparatus I frightened her
off. Pathetically enough, upon looking
into the structure, I discovered that the
bird had been sitting inside an absolutely
empty home.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
The Hedge Sparrow makes her nest of
slender twigs, in limited numbers—sometimes
these are not employed at all—rootlets,
dead grass, and moss, with an inner
lining of wool, hair, and feathers. The
lining frequently consists of no other
materials than moss and cowhair.</p>

<p>The eggs number from four to six, and
are turquoise-blue in colour and unspotted.</p>

<p>Two, and even three, broods are reared

as March and as late as the end of July.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">THE GREENFINCH.</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> Greenfinch, or Green Linnet as it
is called in many parts of the country, is
a thick-set little bird, about six inches, of
a yellowish-green colour, shaded with ash-grey
above, and bright yellow, slightly
tinged with ash-grey, on its under parts.
The female is not quite as large as her
mate, and much duller in colour.</p>

<p>This species is common in nearly all
parts of the country where there are
cultivated fields, small woods, hedgerows,
and gardens. In fact, I should say that
it ranks next to the Common Sparrow
amongst the finches in point of numbers.</p>

<p>Although a somewhat selfish bird, full
of threats and warlike attitudes when
a favourite item of food—such as a sunflower
head full of seeds—has been discovered,
it is sociable to a great extent,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
even during the breeding season. I have
found three or four nests within a yard
or two of each other in a hedgerow, and
Mr. Hudson says that two or three may
sometimes be found even on the same
branch.</p>

<p><div class="figcenter">

 alt="MALE GREENFINCH">
 <p class="caption">MALE GREENFINCH ON THE ALERT
IN A GARDEN IN WINTER.</p>
</div><!--end figure-->
 

<p class="p2">The nest is situated in hedgerows,
gorse bushes, yew, holly, ivy, and other
evergreens, in orchards, gardens, shrubberies,
and on commons, and when compared
with that of the Chaffinch is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
rather large and slovenly structure formed
of slender, dead twigs, rootlets, grass,
and moss lined with hair, down, and
feathers.</p>

<p>The eggs, numbering from four to six,
are white, pale grey, or white tinged
with blue, spotted principally round the
larger end with reddish-brown and purplish-grey.</p>

<p>The male Greenfinch, although not a
great feathered vocalist, has some very
pleasant notes, which he trills by the
half-hour together. In the early part
of the breeding season he sings on the
wing, but later on he grows less energetic,
and is content to deliver his oft-repeated
lay from some favourite treetop.
Individuals differ in the quality of
their notes.</p>

<p>In confinement the Greenfinch soon
becomes very tame and docile, and is
appreciated on this account, and also for
its ability to imitate the notes of other
species.</p>

<p>The call-note is a prolonged <i>twe-e-er</i>,
and when the nest is visited the members
of this species utter a very melancholy
one sounding like <i>tway</i>.</p>

<p class="p2">In winter Greenfinches congregate in
small flocks, and hunt for seeds in stubble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
fields and farmyards. They will associate
with Sparrows, Linnets, and Chaffinches,
and during the winter months
they come regularly to my garden to
take their share of corn, sunflower seeds,
and other food which is provided every
morning for the consumption of all
feathered friends. It is amusing to see
one of these birds rolling a grain of
Indian corn about between its short,
stout mandibles, gradually reducing it
to pieces small enough to be swallowed,
and cleverly rejecting the thin husk in
which it is enfolded, and allowing it to
flutter to the ground.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">THE DARTFORD WARBLER.</h3>

<div class="figleft">
 <img src="images/i120.jpg"
 alt="sprig with flowers">
</div><!--end figure-->

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">This</span> bird received
its popular name
on account of the
fact that it was
first observed
near Dartford in
Kent in 1773. It
is also known by
the very appropriate
name of
Furze Wren in
some parts of
the country, because
it has a
habit of cocking its long tail like a
Common Wren and is very partial to
thick growths of furze.</p>

<p>The Dartford Warbler is about five
inches long, and in addition to its
habit of cocking its tail, which measures
nearly half its entire length, possesses
the lark-like power of erecting the
feathers on the top of its head so as to
form a kind of crest. On his upper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
parts the male is greyish-black, the wings
and tail being blackish-brown and the
outside feathers of the latter broadly
tipped with grey; chin, throat, breast,
and sides chestnut-brown; under parts
white, excepting at the base of the tail,
where they are grey. The female is
browner on her upper parts and lighter
underneath.</p>

<p>Furze-clad commons along the south
coast of England form the home of this
rare, shy, and interesting species, which
there is every reason to fear is growing
still rarer owing to the damage done to
it by such severe winters as those of
1881 and 1895 and the depredations of
egg collectors.</p>

<p>Although a very difficult bird to
observe, and therefore liable to be overlooked,
particularly during dull, wet
weather, when it does not show itself on
the tops of furze bushes, there is every
reason to fear that it has quite vanished
from many of its old Surrey and Sussex
haunts, where I have sought for it day
after day in vain. For obvious reasons
I cannot divulge the whereabouts of
the place where our photograph of the
adult male opposite was secured, by
the kind assistance of a friend who fed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
the bird on mealworms at the same
place, close to his nest and young ones,
morning by morning until he got into
the habit of visiting the top of that particular
furze bush regularly in search of
his breakfast.</p>

</div><!--end figure-->

<p class="p2">The nest is built in the lower parts of
thick furze bushes, and is composed
of small, slender branches of furze, grass
stalks, bits of moss, and wool, with an
inner lining of fine grass and sometimes
a few hairs.</p>

<p>The eggs number four or five, greenish- or
buffish-white in ground colour,
speckled all over with dark olive-brown,
and underlying markings of grey.</p>

<p>Although a bird of weak flight, the
Furze Wren is very active and nimble
when searching from bush to bush for
its food, which consists of flies, moths,
spiders, caterpillars, and other small deer.</p>

<p>It has a hurried little song, which has
been described as “shrill and piping”
by one authority, and “an angry, impatient
ditty, for ever the same,” by
another. Early in the season it is delivered
whilst the singer is hovering in the
air like a Whitethroat, moving his head
from side to side and waving his tail in
all directions, but later more soberly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
from the topmost branch of some furze
bush. The slightest disturbance instantly
silences the vocalist, and he
drops straight into the hiding afforded
by the thick cover below.</p>

<p>The most frequently heard call-note
of this species sounds like <i>pit-it-chou</i> or
<i>pitch-oo</i>, hence its very appropriate
French name of “Pitchou.” It also
has another harsh note, sounding like
<i>cha, cha</i>.</p>

 alt="cluster of flowers">
</div><!--end figure-->

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> Missel Thrush
measures something
like eleven
and a half inches
in length, and is
the largest member
of its family
inhabiting our islands.
It is, perhaps,
more numerous
now than
it has ever been
before, owing to
the long succession of mild, open winters
we have enjoyed and the fact that during
the last century it has greatly increased
its breeding range both to the North and
West. In 1800 it was unknown in Ireland,
but is now abundant in that
country.</p>

<p>On its upper parts the Missel Thrush
is ash-brown in colour, and buffish-white
below, marked with blackish-brown spots.
It may always be distinguished from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
the Song Thrush by its larger size, greyer
colour, and by the fact that when on
the wing it shows a conspicuous white
stripe down either side of its tail.</p>

<p>This bird loves small woods, well-timbered
parks, orchards, and tree-fringed
streams common in the dales
of the North of England. Its nest is
built in the fork of a tree or on a strong
horizontal branch at varying heights of
from three to forty feet from the ground,
but I have never seen it in such a bush
as the Song Thrush would be likely to
patronise. Sometimes it is small and
well concealed, but at others it is large
and quite conspicuous. Occasionally I
have found it adorned on the outside
with lichen matching that growing on
the tree wherein it was built, and even
with green ivy leaves harmonising with
the moss clinging to the trunk of the
tree in which it was situated; but, on
the other hand, I have found nests ornamented
with large pieces of wool waving
in the wind, and even the large wing
feathers of a white barn-door Fowl.
The nest is constructed of a few slender
twigs (sometimes these are quite absent),
grass stems, moss, mud, and wool, with
an inner lining of fine, dead grass.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
The eggs, numbering four or five, vary
from greyish-green to reddish-grey in
ground colour, marked with brownish-red
spots.</p>

<p class="p2">The Missel Thrush, or Storm Cock as
it is called in many parts of the country,
from its habit of singing on the topmost
branches of tall trees during wet,
windy weather, is one of our very earliest
feathered vocalists. I have heard
it piping its bold, defiant notes as early
as in December in the South of England<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
and as late as the end of June in the
Highlands of Scotland, and have found
its nest and eggs from the end of February
until the middle of June.</p>

<p>Although by no means a first-class
melodist, the Storm Cock has some very
sweet notes, and the unpleasant climatic
conditions under which he frequently
delivers them seem to enhance their
value. I have often listened to him,
brave bird! whilst he was swaying to
and fro on the topmost branch of some
wind-swept tree, and I could only catch
a note here and there, the rest being
carried away on a chord of the storm.</p>

<p>Few of our poets have given the Missel
Thrush any attention whatever in their
verse, but one has done it justice in the
following lines:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
    <div class="i1a">“Whilst thou! the leader of the band,</div>
    <div class="i2">Fearless salut’st the opening year,</div>
    <div class="i1">Nor stay’st till blow the breezes bland</div>
    <div class="i2">That bid the tender leaves appear;</div>
    <div class="i1">But on some towering elm or pine</div>
    <div class="i2">Waving aloft thy dauntless wing</div>

</div><!--end figure-->

<p class="p2">This species sometimes imitates the
notes of other birds, but not nearly to
the same extent as its commoner relative,
the Song Thrush, and renders them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
in such an undernote that they are difficult
to hear on account of the singer not
allowing the listener to approach very
closely.</p>

<p>The call note is a harsh, rattling
kind of cry, which, lengthened a little,
and uttered with greater vehemence,
becomes the alarm.</p>

<p>Although shy during the greater part
of the year, this bird grows much bolder
during the breeding season. I have
known it build in a fruit tree within
a few yards of the front door of a
farmhouse, and have seen it attack a
stuffed owl which had been placed near
its nest, containing young ones, and
knock it clean out of the tree.</p>

<div class="figleft">

 alt="thistle flowers">
</div><!--end figure-->

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> earliest recollections
of my old
moorland home
in Yorkshire are
of rushing mountain
torrents, swirling
and gurgling
round limestone
boulders, beneath
which I used to
tickle the lively
little brown trout,
and of white-breasted
Dippers flitting up and down.</p>

<p>The Water Ouzel, as it is sometimes
called, is not at all a sociable bird. It takes
possession of some portion of a stream,
often limited to a few hundred yards in
length, and keeping more or less strictly
to it will not allow any intruder of its
own species to encroach upon its domain.</p>

<p>In appearance it is by no means unlike
a large black Wren with a snowy-white
breast and chestnut under parts.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
It secures its food in the most wonderful
manner when the fact is taken into
consideration that the bird appears to be
no more adapted to the methods it employs
than a Song Thrush. Alighting on
some stone in the middle of a rapid
stream, it deliberately walks down into
the water and swims along the bottom
by a series of wing-beats, picking up
and swallowing as it goes caddis worms,
larvæ of flies, and small molluscs. On
several occasions I have disturbed young
Dippers in the nest when they were ready
to fly, and have seen them one by one
plunge into a deep, clear pool and progress
just as if they were flying slowly
and heavily along under water until
they came to shore or were compelled
to rise to the surface from exhaustion.</p>

<p>The Dipper is a sweet singer, but the
listener requires to be very close to the
little vocalist before he is in a position
thoroughly to appreciate the bird’s low,
soft, warbling song, which, although of
no great length, is practised even in the
middle of winter.</p>

<p>A year or two ago I had occasion to
catch an early train in Westmorland,
and whilst walking through some rock-strewn
pastures to the station came to an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
old wooden bridge crossing the river
Eden. It was close upon Christmas, the
air was biting cold, and everything clad
in the crystal purity of a heavy hoar
frost. Just
as I approached
the river,
day was
breaking,
and my attention
was
arrested by
a sweet,
silvery
snatch of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
song, which I at once recognised as that
of the Dipper. I waited on the footbridge
until it was light enough to see
the bird standing on a moss-clad boulder
in the middle of a dark, glassy pool, and
shall never forget the beauty of the
morning light breaking on the water,
the stillness of the scene amidst the lonely
hills, nor the sweetness of that exquisite
little carol sent out like a flood of joy
on the crisp, winter air.</p>

</div><!--end figure-->

<p class="p2">The call note of the species is <i>zit</i> or
<i>chit, chit</i>, uttered both when the bird is on
the wing and whilst curtseying and dipping
in its own quaint way on some stone
half submerged in a brawling stream.</p>

<p>The bird builds its nest in all kinds of
positions, but never away from flowing
water. It may be found in crevices of
rock, in holes beneath stone bridges, on
large moss-grown boulders in or on the
bank of a stream, behind the falling waters
of a cascade, and in trees overhanging
rivers. It is quite a large structure for
the size of the builder, and is made of
moss securely woven and felted together
on the outside and lined with rootlets,
soft dead grass, and leaves placed layer
upon layer inside. It is dome-shaped,
with the entrance hole placed so low<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
down that the overhanging roof forms
a kind of portico which cunningly prevents
any stray splash of water from
finding its way inside.</p>

<p>The eggs, numbering from four to six,
are pure white, and quite unspotted.</p>

<p>Young Dippers, instead of having
white, conspicuous breasts like their
parents, have the feathers edged with
dusky black, which greatly aids concealment
when they are sitting at rest.</p>

<p>This species breeds in the North and
West of England, Wales, Scotland, and
Ireland wherever there are tumbling,
foaming brooks suitable to its habits.</p>

<p>A spring or two ago I spent several
days inside a hollow, artificial rock, photographing
the bird represented in our
illustration, and was delighted with its
interesting ways. The cock fed the hen,
sitting inside the nest keeping their tiny
chicks warm during some particularly
cold weather for the season, and performed
his task with great diligence and
dispatch.</p>

<p>One day he heard the shutter of my
camera click, and grew inquisitive. As
soon as he had delivered his catch of
larvæ, he hopped from stone to stone,
until he finally stood upon one which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
allowed him to take a peep inside my
hiding contrivance, one corner of which
projected over the bank of the beck in
such a way as to allow me to look down
and see the water rushing past. Cocking
his knowing little head first on one side
and then the other, he looked up at me
and made a most critical examination of
everything he saw. He apparently came
to the conclusion that I was quite harmless,
for when he had satisfied his
curiosity he sang a little song, and
then flew away in search of more food
for his mate and their chicks.</p>

<p class="p2">This species breeds generally throughout
the southern and midland parts of
England, but it is not common in the
northern counties or in Scotland. It is
met with in all suitable districts of Wales
and Ireland, but is everywhere more or
less local.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
Shady woods, well-timbered dells, and
stream-sides with plenty of matured
trees clustering round are beloved haunts
of the Chiffchaff, which builds its nest
on or near the ground amongst tall grass
tangled with brambles and small bushes,
hedge and ditch banks, and sometimes
in ivy growing against trees and walls.
The structure is oval, domed, and has an
entrance hole in the side. It is made of
dead grass, withered leaves, and moss—sometimes
a few fern fronds are employed—and
is lined with hair and feathers.</p>

<p>The eggs, numbering from five to
seven, are white, sparingly spotted with
dark purplish-brown.</p>

<p>It is by no means an easy matter for
the inexperienced ornithologist to distinguish
the Chiffchaff from the Willow
Wren, although the species under notice
is a trifle smaller and duller in colour.</p>

<p>Its song, if two oft-repeated notes can
be dignified by such a name, is, however,
quite unique and impossible to confuse
with that of any other British bird. The
two notes sound something like <i>chiff
chaff</i> or <i>chip chop</i>, and are uttered four
or five times in succession as the bird
hunts from bough to bough and tree to
tree after its insect food.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
To some people it is said to grow exceedingly
wearisome, but to me it always
sounds such a part of the pleasant things

a very common summer
visitor to our shores, arriving
about the second
or third week in April
and taking its departure

October.</p>

<p>It is about five and a half inches in

neck, and reddish elsewhere; wings
dusky, the coverts being edged with
reddish-buff; tail quills dull brown, the

for the aptitude of the bird’s popular

also the rosy tint on her under parts.</p>

<p>This species breeds in suitable localities
all over England, Wales, Ireland,

<p>It builds its nest in all kinds of low
bushes, such as bramble, thorn, briar,
and furze, and is so partial to nettles that
it is generally known amongst country
people as the “Nettle Creeper.” The
structure, though deep, is of a very

grass stems and horsehair, the latter
being used as a lining.</p>

<p class="p2">The song consists of a few sweet and
oft-repeated notes, delivered with great
vehemence, not to say passion, the vocalist
appearing to labour under considerable
excitement whilst hurrying through
his brief carol. This species commences
to sing very early in the morning, and
during May and June often continues<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
until after it is dark. It also sings on
the wing, as well as from the top of a
hedge or bramble bush. Last summer I
sat down to rest between a number of
scattered thorn bushes and a wide old
hedgerow on a Surrey hillside. A few
moments afterwards a small bird left
the hedge and took refuge in one of the
bushes about twenty-five yards below
me. Its notes and the white line on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
either side of the tail told me unmistakably
that it was a Whitethroat. Presently
the little songster shot up into the
air to a height of some twenty or thirty
feet, and with outspread tail and head
and wings, performing all kinds of strange
antics, bubbled out its hurried notes as
it descended to the topmost spray of
the bush which it had just left. This
performance was frequently repeated
until his mate left the hedgerow behind
me and joined him, when his excitement
appeared to abate to some extent.</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> Nightingale
measures a little
over six inches in
length, and is of a
uniform tawny-brown
on its upper
parts, except in the
case of the tail
coverts and quills,
which are of a rusty-red
tinge, conspicuously
seen when the
bird is flying away
from the observer. Chin, throat, and
all under parts greyish-white tinged with
brown on the breast and reddish on the
under tail coverts.</p>

<p>This thrice-welcome migrant arrives
upon our shores in April, and leaves again
in August. It is peculiarly limited in
its breeding area, which extends no
farther west than the Valley of the Exe
and only to York in a northerly direction.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
Of course, odd specimens have
been heard by trustworthy observers
beyond these limits, but they are exceptional,
and the species is unknown
both in Scotland and Ireland. Attempts
have been made from time to time to
induce the bird to extend its range, but
they have one and all proved futile.
The late Sir John Sinclair had numbers
of eggs sent from the South of England
and placed in Robins’ nests in Caithness,
but although the closely allied foster-mothers
successfully hatched and reared
the young Nightingales they went off
and never returned. The experiment of
turning adult birds down in certain parts
of Wales beyond the localities reached
by free members of the species also
proved a failure. It is said to “be
met with only where the cowslip grows
kindly,” but this extraordinary assertion
is difficult to understand, because it is
hard to remember where that common
and hardy plant does not “grow kindly.”</p>

<p>The nest is made of dry grass stalks,
dead leaves, moss, bits of bark, and
fibrous roots, and is lined with fine grass
and horsehair. It is built on or near
the ground, on a little bank at the foot
of a tree, at the bottom of a hedgerow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
or on the stump of a felled tree; in
woods, plantations, copses, quiet gardens,
and on commons where clumps of hazels,
brambles, and briars grow.</p>

<p>The eggs number from four to six, of
a uniform olive-brown or olive-green
colour. Occasionally greenish-blue specimens
are found.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to overpraise the
almost perfect song of this bird, the king
of all British feathered melodists; for
although I greatly admire the vocal
powers of the Song Thrush, Skylark, and
Blackcap, I do not think that any one
of them can come near the Nightingale
for perfection of phrasing, rich mellowness,
or the loud, clear, silvery sound of
its notes. I agree with Mr. Witchell,
who has studied the songs of birds more
closely, perhaps, than any other living
man, when he says:</p>

<p>“This tempestuous song, this wild
melody, the triumphal song of Nature
herself, pierces beyond the ear right to
the heart of the listener.”</p>

<p>The Nightingale is the only bird I
ever remember to have heard singing in
a fog, and this occurred in Surrey a little
before midnight during the third week
in May.</p>

The male members of this species
arrive upon our shores from ten days to
a fortnight earlier than the females, and
sing by night in order to attract the
latter, which travel during the hours of
darkness. As soon as the young ones
are hatched the superb song ceases, and
both parent birds confine their energies
to the wants of the chicks.</p>

<p>Poets of all ages have given the song
of the Nightingale a great deal of attention,
but how strangely they have gone
astray in regard to the bird’s habits! It
appears to have appealed to most of
them on account of its practice of singing
by night, and the touch of melancholy
in the three or four lengthened
notes that commence softly and gradually
rise until they are so loud and
strong that they may be heard at a
great distance. Curiously enough, they
made the mistake of thinking that their
Philomel only sang by night, and was
the solitary bird that did so.</p>

<p>Even our immortal William of Avon
says:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
    <div class="i1a">“The Nightingale, if he should sing by day</div>
    <div class="i1">When every goose is cackling would be thought</div>
    <div class="i1">No better a musician than the Wren.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The fact that the bird sings by day as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
well as by night was known, however,
to the ancients, because Virgil mentions
it. Readers of this little volume will also
gather that other feathered musicians,
such as the Sedge and Grasshopper
Warblers, Woodlark, and Cuckoo, also
sing by night.</p>

<p>Individual members of this species
differ in the quality of their notes, as
was observed as far back as Pliny’s time.</p>

<p>The alarm note sounds like <i>wate, wate</i>,
<i>cur, cur</i>, or <i>witt, krr</i>.</p>

less numerous than its

most plentiful in the
South and East of
England, becoming scarcer
towards the North and

and absent altogether from
Ireland as a breeding species.</p>

<p>It measures just over five inches in

being edged with greyish-brown instead
of chestnut, which distinguishes it from
the Greater Whitethroat. The under

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
This species loves high, thick hedges

with horsehair, in hedges, briar, bramble,
gorse, and other bushes.</p>

The Lesser Whitethroat is inferior to
the Greater as a musician, but makes up
for its deficiency in quality by its liberality
in regard to quantity, for it sings
almost incessantly, especially during
sultry weather, and keeps on until very
late in the summer. Its notes are without
variation, hurriedly delivered, and
sound like <i>sip, sip, sip</i>.</p>

<p>The bird’s call notes have been likened

Although the nest of this species,
which used to be called the Aberdevine
amongst bird-catchers, has been found
occasionally in various parts of England,
it is chiefly known as a winter visitor,
and may be seen, along with flocks of
Redpolls, feeding upon the seeds of the
alder, birch, and larch, from September
until April. It breeds regularly, however,
in the great pine forests of Scotland
and in certain parts of Ireland.</p>

<p>The nest is generally placed on the
branch of a fir at a considerable height
from the ground, although specimens
have been found even in furze and juniper
bushes. It is composed of slender twigs,
dried grass, moss, wool, and horsehair,
lined with vegetable down, rabbit’s fur,
and a few soft feathers.</p>

<p>From four to six eggs are laid, of a
greyish-white ground colour, tinted with
green or pale bluish-green, spotted and
speckled with pale and dark reddish-brown,
sometimes streaked with the
latter colour.</p>

<p class="p2">The song of the Siskin has been likened
to the running-down of a piece of clockwork,
and it used to be a great favourite
amongst stocking weavers in Germany as
a cage pet, on account of the fact that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
the tones of its song mingled so as to resemble
the noise made by stocking looms.</p>

<p>One day I watched and listened to a
cock in a Highland forest for some
time. He sat for a little while on the
topmost spray of a tall fir tree uttering
his somewhat low but sweet and varied
notes, then took an excursion into the air
as if he intended to fly away, but changed
his mind and his course several times,
and on each occasion repeated his melody,
and finally came back and alighted on
the same twig from which he started.</p>

<p>The call notes are shrill and oft-repeated
during flight, sounding something
like <i>tit, tit, tit</i>, or <i>tut, tut, tut</i>.</p>

bird, as this restless,

by far the most
numerous member
of its family
visiting the
British Islands
during the summer.</p>

<p class="p2">It is about four inches and three-quarters
in length, greyish-brown on its
upper parts, streaked with dusky brown;
its chin and throat are white, and under
parts pale buff. Over the eye is a conspicuous
yellowish white streak, which,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
together with the dark stripes on its
back, readily distinguish it from its relative,
the Reed Warbler.</p>

<p>This species breeds in suitable localities
nearly all over the British Islands,
with exception of the Shetlands. I have
met with it in tiny clumps of willows
growing by small stream-sides high up
amongst the Westmorland Fells.</p>

<p>Its home is amongst reeds, rushes,
osiers, brambles, and all kinds of bushes
near to lakes, swamps, rivers, ponds,
and ditches, although it may occasionally
be met with breeding at a considerable
distance from water.</p>

<p>The Sedge Warbler builds its nest in
rushes, brambles, bushes, and almost any
kind of thick, tangled herbage. It is
generally lower down than that of the
Reed Warbler, sometimes quite upon the
ground. I have found it on several occasions
upon young pollards a yard from
the ground, and once in a hedgerow at
an elevation of five or six feet. The
structure is loosely built and composed
of grass and moss outside, lined with
willow down and horsehair. It is frequently
adorned with a large white
feather protruding over the outside
edge or bending inwards in such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
way as to hide the eggs. These number
five or six, of a pale yellowish-brown
clay colour, clouded and mottled with
darker brown, and often streaked at the
larger end with hair-like black lines.</p>

<p>This bird is a persistent singer, with
a harsh voice, an inordinate fancy for
repetition, and a great faculty for
mimicking the cries of other birds. It
is willing to oblige anyone who will
listen to its chattering, half-scolding, and
always hurried song, night or day. A
handful of gravel or mould thrown into
any reeds or bushes wherein a male
Sedge Warbler is roosting will nearly
always induce the bird to pour forth a
stream of melody.</p>

<p>I have frequently heard members of
this species singing nearly all night long
on the Norfolk Broads, and many times
when taking my photographic plates
out of wash at two o’clock in the morning
I have started a chorus around me
by emptying the buckets of water with
a splash over the stern of the little houseboat
in which I was staying.</p>

<p>The male has another peculiarity which
is not often mentioned in books. In the
early part of the season he is fond of
taking little fluttering excursions in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
air a few yards above the reeds whilst
he bubbles forth his merry, hurried song.
This is, no doubt, to attract the females
during the pairing season.</p>

<p>I have heard members of this species
imitate the notes of the Landrail, Common
Sparrow, Nightingale, Whitethroat,
Chaffinch, Robin, Swallow, and Blackbird.
In the case of the last three species
an individual mimicked all their notes
within half a minute, not pausing as the
Marsh Warbler does, but running straight
on in a breathless hurry, and then turning
back to repeat the whole over again.</p>

<p>The alarm cry of the Sedge Warbler
when disturbed is a harsh <i>churr</i>. It also
has another, sounding something like
<i>tut-tut</i>. The bird makes use of a soft
call resembling <i>wheet-wheet</i>.</p>

four and a half
inches in length. Its
crown is crimson-red,
hind part of
head and rest of
upper parts dark
brown, the feathers
being edged with
reddish-brown. Upper
tail-coverts tinged with
crimson. Wings and tail
dusky, edged with pale reddish-brown,
the latter forked. Chin black, throat
and breast rose-pink to vermilion, rest of
under parts light greyish, streaked on the
sides with dull brown. The female is
rather smaller, and lacks the red on her
breast and upper tail-coverts.</p>

<p>The Lesser Redpole has bred, somewhat
erratically it is true, in nearly every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
county in England, but is most numerous
in the northern counties and in Scotland.
It also nests in Ireland, where it
is scarcer in the south than the north.
Its nest is a very pretty little structure
made of a few slender, dead twigs (used
as a foundation), dead grass stalks, moss,
and rootlets beautifully lined with willow
down and occasionally hair and feathers.
It is built in willows, alders, firs, hawthorn,
birch, hazel, and other trees
and bushes. It has also been found in
heather.</p>

<p>The eggs, which number from four to
six, are of a very pale bluish-green
ground colour, spotted generally about
the larger end with orange-red, and
sometimes streaked with a darker tint.</p>

<p>The song of this species is not of a
high order in regard to quality, and has
been variously described by different
authorities. Professor Newton says,
“Towards the end of winter the cocks
break out in song, which, though not
powerful, is lively and agreeable, and
begin to indulge in the characteristic
exultant flight during which it is generally
uttered.” Mr. Henry Seebohm describes
it as “a short, monotonous trill,
clear and not unmusical”; whilst Bechstein’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
judgment is that “Its feeble
warblings are only a low, continued
twittering.”</p>

<p>In spite, however, of its shortcomings
as a vocalist, it is a favourite cage pet,
especially with children, because of its
boldness, docility, and intelligence.</p>

<p>It is called the Lesser Redpole, because
it is rather smaller than its near<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
relative, the Mealy Redpole, which breeds
on the Continent and sometimes visits
this country in winter. The breeding
area of the Lesser Redpole seems to be
almost restricted to the British Islands.
This species flocks during the autumn,
and although many remain with us
throughout the winter, numbers migrate
to the Continent.</p>

<p>The structure is very deep for the size

architecture serves a very useful purpose,

eggs from rolling out and away to certain
destruction.</p>

brooding, and it is a very pretty sight to
see them exchanging places on the nest.</p>

<p>The song of this species somewhat resembles
that of the Sedge Warbler in
being full of chatter, but is not so loud
or harsh, and is delivered, as a rule,
whilst the singer is hiding amongst reeds.
It imitates the note of the Starling, Wagtail,
Swallow, and other birds, but is
vastly inferior to the Marsh Warbler both
as a musician and a mimic. I have
heard it at its best during a calm summer
evening on the Norfolk Broads,
where it sings far into the night and
early in the morning, excepting during
windy weather, which seems to be greatly
disliked by all feathered inhabitants of
reed beds. The following extracts from
one of my old diaries kept during a stay
on Hickling Broad illustrate rather
graphically the influence of wind upon
the vocal activities of birds:</p>

<p class="blockquot">May 27.—“Windy, dark night; not a bird
of any kind to be heard.”</p>

<p class="blockquot">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
May 28.—“Fine calm night. Reed, Sedge, and
Grasshopper Warblers, Snipe, Water Rail, Coot,
Moorhen, Peewit, and other birds all singing
and calling until one o’clock in the morning.”</p>

<p>The song of the Reed Warbler has been
represented as <i>tiri, tier zach zerr, scherk
heid tret</i> by one authority, and as <i>tiri
yach yerr sherk heid tret</i> by another.
Each note is repeated by the singer a
number of times. Its call note is a
harsh <i>turr</i> or <i>choh, choh</i>.</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> Rock Pipit,
although subject
to some seasonal
movement, is a
resident in the
British Islands,
and I have never
yet heard its song
or seen its nest
away from the
sound of the restless
sea. In fact,
it is the only song
bird the ocean
can boast, for although such species as
Skylarks, Twites, Starlings, and Linnets
frequently breed close by the sea, their
haunts are by no means confined to its
shores as is the case with the bird under
notice.</p>

<p>The Rock Pipit is the largest of the
three members of its family breeding in
this country. It is olive-brown above,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
marked with dark streaks in the centres
of the feathers; has a dull white throat
and under parts, the latter streaked and
clouded with dark brown. The bird
harmonises well with the dull brown
rocks upon which it so often sits, and I
have often experienced considerable difficulty
in detecting it when it kept quite
still whilst uttering its call notes.</p>

<p>This species may always be distinguished
with absolute certainty from the
Tree and Meadow Pipits when it is on
the wing by reason of the fact that it
shows no white on either side of its tail.</p>

<p>The Rock Pipit breeds nearly all round
our coasts excepting between the Humber
and the Thames, and loves small islands,
such as those behind which the sun is
setting in the tailpiece to this article.</p>

<p>Its song is very similar to that of the
Meadow Pipit, and consists of a few
short simple tinkling notes delivered with
great cheerfulness, both upon the wing
and whilst the bird is seated on some
favourite rock. The call notes are also
much like those of the Meadow Pipit.</p>

<p class="p2">Its nest is situated under old matted
tufts of grass, overhanging pieces of
rock, and in crevices, and is made of small
pieces of dry seaweed, dead grass of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
various kinds, and a few horsehairs.
Seaweed is not always present in the
structure, and horsehair frequently absent
when the bird is breeding on small
islands where it is not procurable.</p>

<p>The eggs number from four to five, and
have a grey ground colour slightly tinged
with green or reddish-brown, closely
spotted with dull greyish- and reddish-brown.
They are occasionally marked
on the larger end with one or two dark
brown lines, and are larger than those
of the other two members of the family
breeding in our islands.</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">This</span> species is about six inches
in length, and on its upper
parts of a light brown
colour tinged with olive.
Its under parts are
brownish-white, darkest
on the throat, chest,
and sides. The absence
of black or rusty
brown on the top of
the head always readily
distinguishes it from the
male or female Blackcap,
and the colour of its throat and breast
from either of the Whitethroats breeding
in this country.</p>

<p>The Garden Warbler arrives in Britain
about the end of April or commencement
of May, and takes its departure for
Africa in September and October.</p>

<p>It breeds sparingly in nearly all suitable
parts of England except Cornwall,
in Wales, in the South of Scotland, and
occasionally in Ireland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
It generally builds its nest at some
little height from the ground in thorn,
briar, bramble, gooseberry, and other
bushes growing in woods, clumps of trees
in the proximity of streams, orchards,
shrubberies, gardens, and hedgerows.
Sometimes the structure, which is made
of straws, blades of dead grass, and
rootlets, lined with horsehair, is hung
amongst nettles like that of a Whitethroat,
or placed low down in long grass,
mixed with taller wild plants.</p>

<p>The eggs, numbering four or five,
rarely six, vary in ground colour from
white to greenish-white or yellowish-stone-grey,
are spotted, blotched, and
clouded with underlying markings of ash-grey
and buffish-brown. Some specimens
are marbled with brown, and it is
often a difficult matter to distinguish
others from those laid by the Blackcap.</p>

<p class="p2">By most people the Garden Warbler
is considered to rank next to the Blackcap
as a melodist, and the songs of the
two species resemble each other so much
that I have known a naturalist with
a good ear and wide experience unable to
say definitely which bird was singing
until he got a sight of the vocalist.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>Mr. Hudson says that “the Garden
Warbler’s song is like a good imitation of
the Blackcap’s, but it is not so powerful
and brilliant. Some of its notes possess
the same bright, pure, musical quality,
but they are hurriedly delivered, shorter,
more broken up, as it were. On the
other hand, to compensate for this inferior
character there is more of it; the
bird, sitting concealed among the clustering
leaves, will sing by the hour, his rapid,
warbled strain sometimes lasting for
several minutes without a break.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
The song is certainly softer, and lacks
something of the wild dash and irregularity
of that of its relative, but some of
its notes are quite as sweet, and this fact
strikes the listener, particularly when the
bird is heard close at hand in some quiet,
out-of-the-way corner where other vocalists
do not interfere with the full enjoyment
of the Garden Warbler’s song.</p>

<p>The alarm note is a harsh “<i>tech</i>,” sounding
something like the noise made by
two pebbles being struck together.</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">On</span> account of its great
similarity of size, general
appearance, and habitat,
this rare British breeding
species was long confounded
by naturalists
with the Reed Warbler.</p>

<p>The bird is greenish-olive
on its upper parts,
and lacks the rusty-red
rump and sides of the
commoner species. Its
under parts are white,
slightly tinged with yellowish-buff on the
sides where the Reed Warbler is reddish
buff. Its legs are pale flesh-brown in
colour, whereas those of its relative are
dark slaty-brown.</p>

<p>This species does not build its nest
over water, whereas the one with which
it has been confounded nearly always
does so. The structure is composed of
grass stems, and occasionally bits of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
moss intermixed on the outside with an
inner lining of fine dead grass, and nearly
always contains one or two black horsehairs.
It is not so neatly finished as
that of the Reed Warbler, and is generally
suspended amongst nettles, Meadow
Sweet, and Mugwood, the last plant
appearing, where I have studied the
species, to be first favourite.</p>

<p>The eggs, numbering from four to
seven, are easily distinguished from those
of the Reed Warbler by their lighter
ground colour, which is greenish-white
to greenish-blue clouded with underlying
markings of grey and spotted with olive-brown.</p>

<p>It is as a singer of great sweetness
and power, however, that the
bird chiefly concerns us in this little
work.</p>

<p>Last summer I spent several days in
the West of England studying the species,
and whilst I was lying hidden with my
camera within three feet of a nest, had
many opportunities of hearing the exquisite
song of the male to perfection.
Whilst the hen was sitting on the nest
he frequently took up his station on a
bramble spray just above and partly
behind her, and regaled us both with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
most wonderful programme of feathered
music I have ever heard. As a mimic,
the Marsh Warbler is unsurpassable.</p>

<p class="p2">Several times the specimen I listened
to began his concert with the alarm cry
of a Song Thrush, so loud and accurately
rendered that I was completely deceived
into thinking that I was listening to the
notes of a disturbed member of that
species. After a little pause he would
reproduce the warbling notes of a Swallow,
then the <i>tut, tut, tut</i> of a Blackbird,
followed by the full, rich notes of the
Nightingale. He could also reproduce
the call note of a Common Partridge,
and the sweet little song of a Linnet with
equal fidelity. He always appeared to
take great care not to mix his music,
for, after finishing one piece, there was a
noticeable pause before the commencement
of another.</p>

<p>In the case of another pair of birds,
that had been robbed, I noticed that the
male sang much upon the wing as he
flew back and forth from tree to tree
across an osier-grown clay pit.</p>

<p>This species was first discovered in
Somersetshire, and has been found breeding
in Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire, and
Cambridge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
It is a great pity that it should be so
much persecuted by egg collectors, some
of whom seem bent upon ruining its
chances of ever becoming a regular
British breeding species. To listen to the
bird’s exquisite song for ten minutes is
a far greater pleasure than to gaze for
a month at its empty egg shells in a
cabinet.</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> male Reed Bunting,
or Reed Sparrow as it
is frequently called, can
hardly be mistaken for
any other British bird
on account of his conspicuous
velvety black
head and white collar
running from the base
of the bill down the
sides of the neck some distance,
and thence right round to the
back of the head. His back is brownish-black,
the feathers being broadly margined
with reddish-brown and tawny
grey; breast and under parts white,
tinged and streaked with brown towards
the sides. He is rather longer than the
Common Sparrow, and shows a distinct
white streak down either side of his tail
when flying away from the observer.</p>

<p>His mate is smaller and has a brown
instead of a black head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
Although certainly a singer, the Reed
Bunting is not a great feathered musician,
its song consisting of a few simple notes
which the bird delivers with considerable
persistency from the top of a reed or
alder bush. It sounds like <i>te, te, tu, te</i>,
diversified by an occasional discordant
<i>raytsh</i>. Bechstein, the great German
authority on cage birds, says that it
is such an admirer of music that it will
approach an instrument without fear,
and testify to its joy by extending its
wings and tail like a fan and shaking
them.</p>

<p>The alarm cry is a sharp twitter, and
when the male is afraid to approach the
nest (either to take his turn in the labours
of brooding or with food for the young)
on account of some real or fancied danger,
he persistently reiterates three melancholy
notes that sound like “<i>Don’t hit
me.</i>”</p>

<p>This species breeds fairly commonly
near sluggish streams, ponds, swamps,
and large sheets of water with reed-clad
shores.</p>

<p class="p2">Its nest is generally situated amongst
long grass, rushes, nettles, and sedges,
although I have found it in the heather
in the Outer Hebrides, and in a small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
thorn bush quite two hundred yards
away from water in Surrey. The materials
used in the structure are dried grass
and moss with an inner lining of fine
dead grass, hairs, and the feathery tops
of reeds.</p>

<p>The eggs number four to six or even
seven, and are of a purplish-grey or pale
olive ground colour, spotted and streaked
with rich, dark purple-brown.</p>

<p>This bird resides with us all the year
round, and its numbers are increased
during the winter by other members of
its species arriving from the Continent.</p>

forehead and throat

wing-coverts and quills black, the
latter barred across with yellow and
tipped with white. Tail quills black
marked with white, and buffy-white near
their tips.</p>

<p>Seventy years ago this species was
extremely abundant, and as recently
as 1873 a boy caught close upon
five hundred during a single morning
near to Brighton; but it is now, alas!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
comparatively rare, on account of the
reclamation of waste lands having
destroyed its seed-food plants, such as
the thistle and burdock, and the heavy
demands made upon its numbers for
cage pets. Of course, a check has now
been put upon the latter source of
drainage to a great extent by the Wild
Birds’ Protection Acts, and the birds
are obtained from Germany.</p>

<p>During recent years I have met with it
breeding in Surrey, Sussex, Suffolk, Norfolk,
Devonshire, and Westmorland. I
know a place in the second-named county
where as many as ten pairs bred in one
season, and within the last half-dozen
years I have twice seen small flocks in
the autumn near London, which, let us
hope, is an encouraging sign.</p>

<p>It is now rare in Scotland, but has
been described as still common in the
poorer and wilder parts of Ireland.</p>

<p>The Goldfinch is a migratory bird,
although a few individuals winter with
us, and are known in the spring from
members of the species that have spent
the cold season farther south by their
less brilliant colours.</p>

<p class="p2">The nest is placed in the fork of an
apple, pear, or other fruit tree in orchards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
and gardens; sometimes in evergreens
or on the bough of a sycamore or chestnut
tree, and occasionally in a thick
hedgerow. It is composed of rootlets,
moss, dry grass, wool, spiders’ webs, and
lichens on the outside, and has an inner
lining of vegetable down, hairs, and soft
feathers. It is a neat and beautiful
structure.</p>

<p>The eggs number from four to six,
and are greyish-or greenish-white, spotted
and streaked with light purplish-and
reddish-brown and grey.</p>

<p>Although some people do not rank the
Goldfinch very highly as a feathered
vocalist, its twittering song is full of
melody and sweetness, and together with
its striking beauty and lively manners
endear it to the heart of every lover of
the country and its sights and sounds.</p>

<p>Bechstein says, “Its agreeable song,
which is only discontinued during moulting,
is a mixture of tones and harmonies
more or less dwelt upon.”</p>

<p>It sings both when perched and upon
the wing. Instances are upon record of
young Goldfinches taken from the nest
when only two or three days old, reproducing
when they grew up not the
music of their own kind, but the songs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
of other species heard from their places
of captivity.</p>

<p>The poets have not given the bird a

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Although</span> generally distributed

in the Lowlands of
Scotland and certain
parts of Ireland, the
Blackcap Warbler is
not so common in my
experience as the youthful
student would be led
to believe after reading
several books I could
name upon ornithology.></p>

<p>It arrives in this country about the
middle of April, as a rule; but, like many
other migrants, is liable to some variation
of date, being more influenced by
the conditions of the weather than the
readings of the calendar. It takes its
departure again in September, although
specimens have been observed during
every month of the winter in the South
and West of England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
The Blackcap is about five and a half
inches in length, has a jet-black crown
and light olive-brown upper parts, becoming
greyer on the rump; throat and
breast ash-grey, and under parts white.
The female is somewhat similar in appearance,

top of her head is chocolate-brown instead
of
black.</p>

<p class="p2">This species
loves small
woods and
spinnies with
abundant
undergrowth,
shrubberies,
old orchards,
gardens, and
bits of waste
land with
plenty of
brambles and
nettles growing
thereon.
If there is
a sluggish
stream close by, so much the better;
although I have several times found it
breeding far away from water of any kind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
The nest is a flimsy structure placed
at varying heights from two to ten or
twelve feet above the ground in brambles,
nettles, briar, and thorn bushes, privet
and other hedges. It is composed of
straws, fibrous roots, and dead grass,
frequently intermixed with cobwebs, and
lined with hair.</p>

<p>The eggs number five or six, and may
be divided into two types of coloration.
In one they are of a greyish-white ground
colour suffused with buffish-brown and
spotted, blotched, and marbled with dark
brown, similar to those of the Garden
Warbler. In the other they are of a
pale brick-red or crimson hue marked
with deep reddish-brown.</p>

<p>This bird is one of our finest feathered
melodists. Gilbert White was greatly
in love with its vocal powers, and in his
third letter to Daines Barrington says
that the “wild sweetness of its song reminded
him of Shakespeare’s lines in
<i>As You Like It</i>:”</p>

<div class="poem-container">

<p class="p2">In Letter <abbr title="40">XL.</abbr> to Pennant, he says,
“The Blackcap has a full, sweet, deep,
loud and wild pipe; yet that strain is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
of short continuance, and his motions
are desultory; but when that bird sits
calmly and engages in song in earnest,
he pours forth very sweet, but inward
melody, and expresses great variety of
soft and gentle modulations, superior
perhaps to those of any of our warblers,
the Nightingale excepted.”</p>

<p>Everyone who has heard and seen the
Blackcap will at once recognise the truth
and accuracy of this; but, strangely
enough, Gilbert White never once mentions
the Garden Warbler in his writings.</p>

<p>The estimate of a wild bird’s song is
like that of the voice of a public singer—to
some extent a matter of individual
opinion. Personally, though by no
means disposed to underrate the beauty
and power of the Blackcap’s song, I do
not think that it approaches so near in
quality to that of the Nightingale, or
is so far superior to that of the Garden
Warbler as some observers appear to
believe.</p>

<p>The Blackcap is a very shy, retiring
bird, preferring to be heard rather than
seen. The male takes his share of the
duties of incubation, and it is said that
he beguiles the tedium of his task by
singing whilst sitting on the nest. I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
watched him brooding on several occasions,
but in spite of long vigils have
never had the gratification of hearing a
single note.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, the poets have given
this superb singer very little attention,
probably because they were seldom in a
position to identify the vocalist, however
much they admired his music.</p>

<p>The alarm note of this species sounds
something like <i>tack-tack</i> or <i>teck-teck</i>.</p>

account of the facts
that its engaging

made it a favourite cage pet. It may
be necessary, however, to mention that
the female differs from her mate in

her back is greyish-brown, and her breast

colour instead of bright tile red.</p>

<p>Both male and female may always be
instantly identified when on the wing
by the conspicuous patch of white on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
the rump, and when not seen the presence
of the species is easily known by its
unmistakable plaintive call note, which
is constantly uttered whilst the birds
are hunting in pairs or families for food
along a hedgerow or from bush to bush
in a wood. It sounds something like
<i>wheon</i>.</p>

<p class="p2">This species has profited more by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
Wild Birds’ Protection Acts than perhaps
any other breeding in our country.
It is as much hated by some people on
account of the harm it does to the buds
of fruit trees, as it is loved by others as
a cage pet. It has increased greatly in
numbers nearly all over the country
during the past ten years, as may be
judged when it is mentioned that over
forty were shot in one Essex garden last
spring. Let us hope that the damage
done to buds and branches by small shot
expended during the slaughter may not
be put down to the credit of the unfortunate
feathered victims.</p>

<p>In a secluded Surrey wood, where I
spend a good deal of time every July
and August studying and photographing
birds from the interior of a small
green tent pitched near to a place where
birds come all day long to drink and
bathe, I notice that the Bullfinch is my
most frequent visitor. Sometimes an old
male will come along in silence, take a
few hurried sips, and then abruptly depart,
indicating that he has a sitting
mate, and at others whole families arrive
to quench their thirst, which appears to
be abnormal in this species, and to enjoy
a good bath.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
The Bullfinch breeds in suitable localities
throughout the British Isles, but,
according to my experience, is commonest
in the South of England. Its nest
is of rather singular construction, consisting
of a little platform of slender
dead twigs cleverly interlaced with a
somewhat shallow recess in the middle,
beautifully lined with fine, fibrous roots
and sometimes a little hair. The structure
is placed from three to six feet from
the ground, as a rule, in whitethorn,
blackthorn, briar, and other bushes, also
in yew and other evergreen trees growing
in gardens, shrubberies, woods, and
thick hedgerows.</p>

<p>The eggs number from four to six,
of a pale, greenish-blue ground colour,
spotted, speckled, and sometimes streaked
with purplish-brown, most thickly at
the larger end.</p>

<p>The female Bullfinch is a confiding
creature whilst brooding, as will be
gathered by my readers when I state
that the one figured in our illustration
became so tame through kind and gentle
treatment that she would actually allow
me to take her in my hand and place
her in any attitude I wished upon the
nest before taking a photograph of her.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
I secured a large series of pictures of
this particular bird on and near her nest.</p>

<p>The song of this species is short and
very soft. One day a fine male alighted
on a bare branch close to my hiding tent
and held forth with his head on one side,
as if listening to the sound of his own
voice, whilst his body seemed to throb
with the effort of producing even such
feeble notes as he commanded.</p>

<p>Bullfinches learn the song of the
Canary when brought up under that
bird, instead of the notes of their own
species, and can be taught in confinement
to whistle all kinds of airs and melodies.</p>

thick-set little bird
measuring about six
inches in length. It
arrives in the South of
England about the end
of February and beginning
of March, and
leaves our shores again
in August and September.
It has the top of
the head, nape, and

light brown, rump and upper two-thirds
of tail pure white. Wings nearly black,
with buff margins and tips to some of

throat dull white; breast pale creamy
white, turning to a dull yellowish-white
on the under parts. The female is somewhat
browner on her upper parts than
the male. The Wheatear may always be
readily distinguished by the large white
patch at the base of its tail, seen most
conspicuously when the bird is flying
away from the
observer.</p>

<p class="p2">The nest is situated
under loose slabs of rock, in
holes in rough, dry stone walls, peat
stacks, and rocky banks. I have met
with it on two or three occasions in
the old nesting burrows of rabbits. It
is made of dead grass, rootlets, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
moss, with an inner lining of hair,
feathers, and rabbits’ down.</p>

<p>The eggs generally number five or six,
of a pale greenish-blue, occasionally
spotted on the larger end with rusty red.</p>

<p>This species practises a short and somewhat
pretty, but not very loud, song,
which is enhanced in value by the
weird solitude of the vocalist’s surroundings.
It is frequently uttered
whilst the bird is on the wing going

This species does not live, as its name
might be taken to imply, in stony wildernesses,
but upon furze-clad commons
and uncultivated land where juniper,
brambles, and other kinds of tangled
vegetation grow. The nest is built upon
or near the ground, and is generally well
concealed. It consists of rootlets, moss,
and dry grass, with an inner lining of
hair, feathers, and occasionally pieces of
wool. I have often seen it with very
little else than fine blades of dead grass.</p>

<p>The eggs number from four to six, and
on rare occasions even seven have been
found. They are of a pale bluish-green
ground colour, closely spotted round the
larger end with reddish-brown. Sometimes
the spots are entirely absent.</p>

<p>The Stonechat, although subject to
local movement, stays with us all the
year round. Its soft, low song, although
of no great length or importance, is sweet
and pleasing, and sometimes contains
imitations of other birds’ notes. It is
delivered both whilst the singer is at rest
and hovering in the air. The male
helps the female to feed the young ones,
and in the case of the chicks hatched
from the eggs figured on the previous
page he had the whole of the domestic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
work to do because his mate disappeared
altogether a few days after the young
ones had been hatched.</p>

<p>The call note resembles the sound
made by striking two small pebbles together
in the hand, hence its name of
Stonechat. It has been written down as
<i>u-tic, u-tic</i>. After the young are hatched
it changes somewhat and sounds like
<i>chuck, chuck</i>.</p>

pastures, and meadows, where
it makes its nest on or near the ground
in thick tangled grass, heather, and at
the bottom of small gorse bushes. The
structure is formed of dead grass and

<p>The song is low, but sweet, and is delivered
somewhat hurriedly, both whilst

of the appearance
of this well-known
and greatly beloved
carol singer, which is
called a Song Thrush
in the South, a
Throstle in the North
of England, and a
Mavis in Scotland. It
breeds commonly
throughout the British
Islands wherever there is any kind of
cover in the shape of trees, shrubs, or
bushes to give it shelter. Some people
think that the Song Thrush resides with
us all the year round, but this is only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
partially true. I know many high, bleak
parts of the country where it is never
seen during the depth of winter, and,
as a matter of fact, those that stay with
us in the lower and more sheltered regions
are only a fraction of the total number
bred in our country.</p>

<p class="p2">The nest of the Song Thrush is built
in evergreens, hedgerows, bushes, ivy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
growing against walls and trees, holes
in stone walls, on ledges of rock, on beams
in sheds, and occasionally, though not as
often as that of the Blackbird, absolutely
on the ground. It is quite unlike that
of any other British bird in its construction,
being made of twigs, coarse dead
grass, moss, and clay or mud outside,
with an inner lining of clay, mud, or
cow-dung studded with bits of rotten
wood. In some districts where decayed
wood is difficult to procure, it is dispensed
with altogether, and during very
droughty summers I have found several
nests occupied by eggs without a vestige
of a hard lining. They were similar to
those of the Blackbird, only not so
neatly lined with fine dead grass. The
mud lining is generally allowed to dry
hard before the bird commences to lay.</p>

<p>The eggs, numbering from four to six,
are of a beautiful deep greenish-blue
colour spotted with black. I have on
several occasions met with unmarked
specimens.</p>

<p class="p2">As a melodist the Throstle ranks very
high. Many people consider that it
comes next to the Nightingale, for which
it is often mistaken, when singing very
late in the evening, by people who can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
claim no great acquaintance with the
superb notes of Sweet Philomel.</p>

<p>Mr. Swaysland, of Brighton, who has
had a great deal of experience amongst
feathered musicians, says that the song
of the Mavis is “clear, yet full of mellowness—now
pealing out a phrase of wild
bluff heartiness, and anon with long-drawn
notes tinged with exquisite pathos—striking
a responsive chord in the heart
of every hearer.”</p>

<p>I have heard its song during every
month of the year excepting August,
when the bird experiences the depression
of its annual moult.</p>

<p>During a fine April morning every
wood and spinny in the part of Surrey
where I reside rings with the melodious
notes of the Throstle, and two or three
seasons ago we had a specimen that
habitually sang from the top of a cabbage
in a field almost surrounded by tall
trees. I have heard it sing on the
ground between bouts of fighting, on
the wing, and from a housetop, where a
Starling might have been expected to
hold forth. It has been timed, and in
one instance at least has been found to
sing sixteen hours in a single day, and
under favourable circumstances some of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
its notes may be heard half a mile
away.</p>

<p>If not the most imitative of all British
birds, it comes very close to the holding
of that distinction, and can not only
mimic some notes as well as their owners
can deliver them, but actually improve
upon their volume and sweetness. The
Ringed Plover and the French Partridge
are two examples. I have heard the
Throstle reproduce the notes of the following
species: Common Curlew, Whimbrel,
Dunlin, Peewit, Golden Plover,
Common Tern, Redshank, Ringed Plover,
French Partridge, and Common Sparrow,
besides those of several others.</p>

<p>Thrushes vary not only individually as
musicians, but in different parts of the
country, I am persuaded. Some of the
finest singers I have heard have been in
Surrey, Cheshire, and Aberdeenshire.</p>

<p>The poets have given this species a
good deal of deserved attention on
account of the excellence of its song, and
everyone who has had any experience
whatever of the country and its wild life
in springtime will at once recognise the
truth and beauty of the following lines:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
    <div class="i1a">“Through the hazels thick espy</div>
    <div class="i1">The hatching throstle’s shining eye.”</div>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
The call and alarm notes of the Song
Thrush are very difficult to convey by
the characters of the alphabet. The
former sounds something like <i>sik, sik
sik, sik, siki, tsak, tsak</i>, and the latter
<i>quep</i> and <i>wich-it-tit</i>. The song has been
rendered by the words, “Go-it, go-it,
stick-to-it, stick-to-it, you’ll-do-it, you’ll-do-it,”
but by far the best representation
is that of the great Scottish naturalist,
Macgillivray, which I have quoted at
length in “Our Bird Friends.”</p>

<p class="p2">Throstles live principally upon worms,
grubs, and snails, and they have a habit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
of taking the last-named to some favourite
stone, where they hammer the shell
until it is sufficiently fractured to enable
them to extract the luscious morsel inside.
These stones are known as
“Thrushes’ Anvils.” Occasionally when
they find a snail with a house upon its
back too hard and strong to be broken
in this way, they carry it to some height
in the air and drop it on a flag or other
hard substance. The shell is thus fractured,
and the sensible captor descends
and devours its prey. The bird also
takes its share of fruit, and without any
consideration for the good it does during
the greater part of the year, is ruthlessly
slain by gardeners, who might, in the
great majority of instances, use netting
instead of shot to the advantage of both
fruit trees and birds.</p>

<p>When I hear a garden-loving neighbour’s
gun going off, I frequently think
of the poet’s compassionate appeal:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
    <div class="i1a">“Scare, if ye will, his timid wing away,</div>
    <div class="i1">But oh, let not the leaden viewless shower,</div>
    <div class="i1">Vollied from flashing tube, arrest his flight,</div>
    <div class="i1">And fill his tuneful, gasping bill with blood.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The members of this species that stay
with us throughout the winter months,
when not regaling our ears with their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
versatile songs, amuse even the most
casual observers by their quaint ways of
listening for and catching worms on
lawn and meadow during open weather.
They also well repay feeding with soaked
dog-biscuits and other edible trifles during
severe weather, when it is almost impossible
for them to secure even the shortest
supply of natural food. They are able
to foretell coming changes in the weather
far earlier than human beings, and frequently
sing in anticipation of a thaw.</p>

North to the effect that Satan supplies
the bird with half a drop of his blood
every morning wherewith to mark its
eggs with the greatly varied scribbling
lines that appear upon them.</p>

<p>The song, although more musical than
that of the Corn Bunting, is considered
by many people to be a monotonous
performance. The poet Grahame was
evidently aware of this when he wrote
the lines:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
    <div class="i1a">“Even in a bird the simplest notes have charms</div>
    <div class="i1">For me: I even love the yellow hammer’s song.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The call note of this species, when disturbed,
is a <i>trit, trit, trit</i>, and on the
wing <i>tisit</i>.</p>

<p>It may always be distinguished with
certainty from its much rarer relative,
the Cirl Bunting, by the fact that it has
no black upon its chin.</p>

<p>The female Yellow Hammer is a trifle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
smaller than her mate, is much less
yellow, and the markings on her head are
darker. Both sexes take a share in the
work of incubation.</p>

<p class="p2">The nest is built in hedge banks, at the
foot of light open bushes, under brambles,
and sometimes even in gorse bushes and
thick evergreen hedges at a considerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
height from the ground. It is composed
of dry grass, rootlets, and moss
on the outside, with an inner lining of
fine, dead grass and horsehair.</p>

<p>The eggs, numbering from four to six,
are of a dingy white ground colour,
tinged with purple, streaked, spotted, and
blotched with dark purplish-brown. The
streaks or scribblings generally end in a
spot, and, on account of their similarity
to the marks made by a pen, the bird is
known in many parts of the country as
the “Writing Lark.”</p>

<p>This species, although commencing to
breed in April, sometimes has eggs as
late even as September.</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> is quite unnecessary
for me to
describe the appearance
of the Starling,
for the species is so
common, sociable,
and unlike every
other feathered
friend in this country
that confusion
is almost impossible.</p>

<p>I love the brave,
bustling bird, for
when it has any
work to do it does not go dawdling
along like a lazy boy crawling halfheartedly
to school, but rushes about as
if the welfare of the whole universe
depended upon its individual exertions.</p>

<p>It is a lively singer, with almost unrivalled
powers of imitation, and has,
I must confess, completely deceived me
on several occasions. One fine spring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
morning, whilst on my way to a railway
station in the north of London, I heard,
to my surprise, the familiar notes of a
Golden Plover, and immediately began
to examine the heavens for a member of
that species flying overhead. To my
surprise, I discovered that the sounds
were coming from a Starling delightedly
flapping its wings on a chimney-pot
not far away. On another occasion,
whilst hunting for a much-desired Sandpiper’s
nest on the shores of a small loch
in the Outer Hebrides, I said to my
brother, “Hark! I hear one calling!”
But that Sandpiper proved to be a Starling
standing on a rock not far off imitating
to perfection the soft call notes of
the little wader. I have heard different
members of this species mimicking the
cries and call notes of the Curlew, Whimbrel,
Lapwing, Common Partridge, Redshank,
Ringed Plover, House Sparrow,
and other small birds.</p>

<p>Tame Starlings have been taught to
imitate the human voice so well that one
has been said to repeat the Lord’s Prayer
from beginning to end, and Pliny, the
historian, mentions one that was able
to speak in both Greek and Latin.</p>

<p>The harsh alarm cry of the species<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
sounds something like the word <i>spate,
spate</i>.</p>

<p>Although sometimes guilty, especially
during very dry seasons, of taking cherries
and other fruit, the damage wrought
in this way is as nothing compared with
the vast amount of good done by this
species in the destruction of insects injurious
to growing crops. It is an amusing
sight to watch a flock hurrying and
scurrying across a field, the hindmost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
members continually flying over the foremost
and then running in breathless
haste looking eagerly this way and that,
probing every likely and unlikely place
for some lurking grub, as if life did not
contain one moment to be wasted.</p>

<p>They alight on the backs of sheep and
cattle in order to destroy troublesome
parasites, and at certain seasons of the
year may be seen dexterously hawking
winged insects over houses and tree-tops.</p>

<p>Starlings have greatly increased in
numbers during the last forty years in
our islands, and there is no season of the
year when flocks, great or small, cannot
be seen. Late breeders keep together
until far on in May, and the broods of
those that commenced housekeeping
operations early in April flock together
directly they meet each other in the
fields. Thus I have known the same
nesting hole occupied twice in one season,
a fact which has given rise to the belief
entertained by some people that the
species is double-brooded.</p>

<p class="p2">When flocked, these birds have favourite
roosting places, to which they resort
in tens of thousands every night with
the utmost regularity. Sometimes they
select a reed bed to sleep in, and do great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
damage by too many birds alighting on
the same stems and breaking them down.
Before finally settling for the night, they
perform a great number of wonderful
aërial evolutions, especially during fine
weather. Whilst sitting in one black
mass on every available branch and
bough, producing an indescribable din
by all chissicking and chattering to each
other at the same time, they will suddenly
become quite silent, and leaping
into the air with a noise just like that of
a truck-load of small coals being shot
into the hold of a steamer, mount to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
considerable height, and commence to
wheel and turn as if by some magically
communicated command.</p>

<p>At one moment they look like a thick
black cloud, and at another like a long
trail of grey smoke. Every turn and
twist, opening and closing of the whole
flock, is performed with a grace and precision
of movement which is wonderful
to behold.</p>

<p>Starlings nest in holes in trees, rocks,
and old ruins; under the roofs of
houses, in the thatch of ricks and outbuildings,
and sometimes under large
stones on steep hillsides. I have also
known them breed amongst sticks forming
the base of an Osprey’s eyrie which
was occupied by young ones. A year
or two ago I found an open-topped
nest containing chicks in an evergreen,
where a Blackbird or Thrush might
have been expected to breed. Green
Woodpeckers are constantly turned out
of their laboriously dug holes by members
of this species in search of suitable
nesting quarters.</p>

<p>The nest is a loosely-put-together structure
composed of straws, rootlets, and
bits of moss, with a lining of hair, feathers,
and occasionally a lock of wool. I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
often found nests, however, with no kind
of lining at all except straws.</p>

<p>The eggs number from four to six, of
a uniform pale blue colour. This species
has a curious habit of dropping its eggs
about on lawns and in fields during the
early part of the breeding season.</p>

<p>Young Starlings, in their first coats
of feathers, are greyish-brown, and lack
entirely the beautiful purple and steel-blue
sheen which gives their parents
such a handsome appearance when the
sun is shining upon them.</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Youthful</span> students of
ornithology are frequently
at a loss to
understand why Linnæus,
the great Swedish
naturalist, gave this
bird the somewhat odd
scientific name of
<i>cœlebs</i>, signifying bachelor.
He did so because
he noticed that
in his own country the
females left the males
behind in winter and migrated south in
search of more hospitable climes.</p>

 <p class="caption">CHAFFINCH ON THE NEST</p>
</div><!--end figure-->

<p class="p2">In Scotland and the North of England
I have frequently observed the same kind
of thing happen, and especially during
severe winters, not a female to be seen
for weeks together, and the males all congregated
in little flocks. In the South
and West of England, however, both
sexes remain together, as a rule, and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
associating with their relatives, the Common
Sparrows, hunt farmyards and
gardens for corn, seeds, and any other
unconsidered trifles they may chance to
pick up.</p>

<p>However gloomy the conditions of
existence may be, the brave Chaffinch is
always sprightly, vigorous, and cheerful,
a characteristic which may be plainly
seen in our illustration of birds feeding
on the snow.</p>

<p>The call note of the species is a loud,
ringing <i>spink, spink</i>, which is also used
as an alarm cry. In the spring the
male utters in addition a very sweet
one sounding something like <i>tu-wheet, tu-wheet</i>.
During flight the bird makes use
of another note, which is difficult to
render by the characters of the alphabet,
but may, perhaps, be best represented
by the letters <i>tuke</i>.</p>

<p>The song is repeated thousands of
times per day in the early part of the
breeding season. It is a very sprightly
performance, like a merry old English
catch, <i>tol-de-rol, lol, chickweedo</i>, which
has been very aptly likened to the words,
“Will you, will you kiss me, dear?”
Some people consider it a monotonous
affair, but in spite of the fact that I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
heard it repeated twenty-one times in
four minutes it is always to me, “A full,
clear, sprightly ringing ditty.” It varies
greatly in individuals, and although
London bird-catchers consider an Essex
Chaffinch superior to all others as a singer,
I prefer to listen to some members of the
species I have heard cheering the dark
solitude of great Highland pine forests.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
German workmen are great Chaffinch
fanciers. One has been known to exchange
a cow for a clever vocalist of this
species, and another to live upon bread-and-water
until he had saved the high
price of a prime favourite.</p>

<p>It is, I must confess, always a saddening
experience for me to hear this little
songster’s notes ringing clear and sweet
from the interior of a wee prison house
tied up in a black cloth, and carried along
some dismal street beneath the arm of a
costermonger. However, it is only fair
to add that these men are, as a rule,
devoted to their pets, and treat them
with the utmost kindness. A great
authority upon the subject says that if
well treated a Chaffinch will live in confinement
for twenty years. It has also
been asserted as a curious fact that if an
adult male Chaffinch is caught before
Whitsuntide he will sing in a cage, but if
he should be made a prisoner after this
date he will die of grief at being parted
from his mate and young ones.</p>

<p>Chaffinches pair towards the end of
February and throughout March, although
flocks of “bachelors” may occasionally
be seen as late as the first week
in May, and commence building operations,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
as a rule, about the middle of
April. They build deep, cup-shaped, and
wonderfully neat little nests of moss,
wool, lichens, and cobwebs, beautifully
felted together and securely fixed in the
forks of small trees in orchards, hedgerows,
and woods. It is generally adorned
on the outside with bits of green moss
or grey lichens that will render it similar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
in appearance to its surroundings, and
thus help it to escape detection.</p>

<p>The female Chaffinch lacks the rich
colouring of her mate, especially on the
head and breast, and is a trifle smaller.
The young are fed upon insects by both
parent birds, and resemble their mother
in appearance whilst wearing the first
coat of feathers.</p>

a singularly well-named
species, because it answers
both adjective and noun
exactly.</p>

<p>The male is not quite
as large as a Robin, and
is, generally speaking,
black and white, as shown
in our illustration on the
next page. In fact, a
little girl who saw the picture,
exclaimed, “What
a pretty wee Magpie!”
The small patch of white on the forehead

<p class="p2">This species is partial to certain parts
of the country, and although by no
means common is to be met with in the
six northern counties of England, in Wales,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
and in some parts of Scotland. Some
authorities say that it is most numerous
in the Lake District, but I have met
with far more specimens in certain parts
of the Principality than anywhere else.</p>

<p>The male has a very pretty, though
short and oft-repeated song. It resembles
that of the Redstart so closely
that it is difficult to say with certainty
which bird is producing the music unless
the singer be seen. This also applies
to its call notes.</p>

<p>A male Pied Flycatcher is a creature of
decided character. The one figured in
our photograph was busy feeding his
mate, sitting on six beautiful pale blue
eggs, in a hole in an old tree, which had
been struck and partially destroyed by
lightning, when a friend of mine and I
discovered him. Upon our examining
the nesting site the female fluttered out,
and joining her mate, they flitted about
together from tree to tree until he evidently
thought it was time for her to
return to her maternal duties. She was,
however, afraid to venture back to her
nest because my camera stood within
a few feet of the entrance hole, and
flew nervously from one branch to
another in the neighbouring trees. Her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
mate, with the evident intention of showing
her that there was no cause for alarm,
came along and, alighting right in front
of my apparatus, took a leisurely peep
inside the nesting hole. As this had no
visible effect upon her nerves he went
off and secured a fat, green caterpillar,
which he would not offer her anywhere,
although she shivered her little wings in
supplication, excepting on the threshold
of their breeding quarters.</p>

<p>As even this kind of inducement
failed, he indignantly gulped down the
food, and with a great show of anger,
began to chase her round and round, up
and down, until at last he forced her indoors.
Later on, this female grew bolder,
however, and I succeeded in photographing
her on the gnarled trunk of the
lightning-blasted tree.</p>

<p>A precisely similar kind of thing happened
at another nest, but in this instance
the lady was stronger minded, and
refused to be bullied into the performance
of her duties.</p>

<p>In this particular wood, which was of
no great size, four pairs of these interesting
birds lived within a few hundred
yards of each other. The males appeared
to spend the day in catching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
winged and other insects for the females,
in singing, and chasing each other away
from particular spheres of influence.</p>

<p>The Pied Flycatcher, like its commoner
relative, the Spotted Flycatcher, is a
migratory bird, arriving in this country
in April and leaving again in September
and October.</p>

<p>It builds its nest generally in holes in
trees, but sometimes in old walls. The
structure is composed of dry grass, dead
leaves, and moss, with an inner lining of
hair and feathers.</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Male</span> Linnets vary
almost as much in
the colour of their
feathers as they do
in the quality of
their songs. A fine
specimen, arrayed

his summer dress,
has the forehead and
crown glossy blood-red,
the rest of the
head black, and sides
of the neck brownish-grey, back and
upper wing coverts deep reddish-brown;
wing quills dusky, edged with white;
upper tail coverts dark brown; tail
quills brownish-black, edged with white,
except in the case of the two centre
feathers; chin and throat greyish-white,
streaked along the middle with greyish-brown;
breast glossy rose-red. The
last-named colour varies greatly in intensity,
and in some birds is almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
absent. In fact, as Yarrell says, perfect
specimens are not often met with, and
the carmine cap and breast are generally
replaced by brownish lake-red.</p>

<p>Some adult male Linnets have lemon-yellow
breasts, and in Germany are considered

Lesser Redpole by having no white bar
on the wings and no black upon the chin,

<p>Last spring I
spent two days
on a Surrey
common photographing
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
Stonechat figuring in the little picture
which decorates the front cover of this
book. He was bringing food to his offspring
in a nest situated amongst some
stunted heather growing in a sheltered
dell formed by two gorse-clad ridges
about eighty feet in height and a hundred
yards apart. Although many Linnets
were still roaming the countryside in
flocks, numbers were busy love-making
and pairing close around me, and I shall
never forget the sweetness of the twittering
and warbling that went on all day
long.</p>

<p>The carols were generally sung from
the topmost spray of some furze bush,
which was a golden blaze of bloom, but
occasionally the vocalist would utter his
sweetest notes when dropping gracefully
through the air to some intended
resting-place.</p>

<p>This bird has received a great deal of
attention from the poets, some of whom
have described its song as a “careless
lay” and others as a</p>

and is situated in gorse, and broom
bushes, white and black thorn bushes,
tall heather, and juniper. I have found
a nest ten feet from the ground, and
two nests quite upon it.</p>

<p>The eggs number four to six, are greyish-white
in ground colour, tinged with
blue or green and speckled and spotted
with purple-red and reddish-brown.</p>

<p>A very strange thing about this species
is that it appears to grow shyer during
the breeding season, whereas nearly all
other birds grow bolder. This peculiar
characteristic, of course, increases the
difficulty of photographing the creature.</p>

<p>Linnets flock together as soon as the
breeding season is over—some of them
to migrate, and others to wander about
the country visiting stubble fields and
waste lands in search of seeds. It is a
very pleasant sight to watch a flock
resting on the sunlit top of some tall
tree on a fine winter’s day, and hear the
sociable little birds holding a kind of
chattering concert.</p>

<p>It is almost needless to add that the
Linnet is a great favourite as a cage pet.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
Specimens caught in the autumn soon
adapt themselves to confinement, but
those taken in the spring frequently
mope and die. One has been known to
live as many as fourteen years in a cage,
but I have never yet heard of a specimen
in confinement donning the crimson
colour on its head or breast.</p>

<p>The species has derived its name in
several European countries from its fondness
for linseed.</p>

from either the Swift or the Martin, by
its much more deeply forked tail.</p>

<p class="p2">Its nest is generally built in a chimney
or on a rafter in a barn, stable, or shed,
although I have seen it plastered against
a smooth whitewashed wall, on a dangling
tendril of ivy that had grown through
the roof of a shed, under a stone bridge,
inside an old limekiln, on a ledge under
the eaves of a shed, on a picture-frame,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
and inside an old tennis shoe left on a
ledge in a boat-house. It is made of
pellets of mud generally intermixed with
straws and lined with dead grass and
feathers. The structure differs in shape
according to the
site selected for
it. Frequently
it is formed like
half or two-thirds
of a saucer when
plastered against
a wall or rafter,
but when on a
flat surface the
outside consists of
a circular wall of
mud.</p>

<p>This bird’s song is one of the most joyous
and spontaneous in all the realms of
Nature, and the poet might well say:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
    <div class="i1">“Thou hast no sadness in thy song.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is uttered both whilst the melodist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
is flashing at lightning speed through
the air and at rest on some house-top
or tree, and is an exceedingly sweet and
exhilarating warble frequently repeated.</p>

<p>During dull weather, when swallows fly
low, they utter a note like <i>wet wet</i>, and
their alarm cry has been fittingly written
down as <i>feetafeet-feetafetit</i>. Inside buildings
they also use another, which is a
clear, ringing <i>pink pink</i>.</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> Golden-crested Wren,
or Gold-crest, as it is frequently
called, has the distinction
of being our
smallest British bird, measuring
only three and a
half inches in length. It
is a widely distributed
resident, and breeds comparatively
close to London
and other large towns. On
the forehead and round
the eyes it is whitish,
tinged with olive-green. Crown pale
orange in front and bright yellow
towards the hind part. The feathers
are somewhat lengthened, and form a
crest bounded on either side by a streak
of black. Upper parts olive-green;
wings dusky black with two transverse
white bars. Tail quills dusky, edged with
yellowish-green. Under parts yellowish-grey,
inclining to buff on throat, breast,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
and sides. The female is not so brightly
coloured as her mate.</p>

<p>The nest is generally, though not always,
suspended from the branch of a
cedar, spruce, fir, yew, or holly tree at
varying heights from the ground. I have
seen it in a furze bush, and at an elevation
of thirty feet or more from the
ground in a fir tree. It breeds in shrubberies,
plantations, and spinnies, and
makes its nest of green moss, lichens,
fine grass, spiders’ webs, and hair beautifully
felted together and lined with
liberal quantities of down and feathers.</p>

<p>The eggs number six or seven, as a rule,
and are pale flesh or yellowish-white in
ground colour, spotted and blotched with
reddish-brown, the markings being most
numerous at the larger end.</p>

<p>The Gold-crest’s song is like its singer—very
small, soft, and sweet. It is
difficult to hear, especially towards the
end, unless the listener happens to be
very close. In the neighbourhood of
Birmingham I once had the pleasure of
listening to a bird of this species in an
evergreen hedge only two or three feet
away from me, and was greatly surprised
at the sweet melodiousness of its limited
notes.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
The sound of its call is something like
<i>tsit, tsit</i>.</p>

<p>Vast flocks of this wee species occasionally
hazard the perils of a journey
from the Continent across the North Sea
in order to visit our shores, and at such
times alight upon the rigging of fishing
smacks to rest, and crowd round lighthouses
in incredible numbers.</p>
